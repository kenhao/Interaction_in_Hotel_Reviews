Though there was no where for a second suitcase other than the doorway. The lifts where an absolute joke you spend so much wasted time WAITING for lifts that come and are full. 4 lifts only 2 go to lower floors and one of them is a service lift. This was a daily frustration.  People off the streets get invited into bars and restaurants so you have to battle for the lifts with them as well. I also found no discounts at restaurants or bars for guests disappointing. $21.00 for a house vodka and Soda is just ridiculous! $250 for the day bed and $500 for the cabana by the pool is hi-way robbery. Very disappointing for the price you are paying to stay here.",-0.7069,1,0

As a business guy who likes to stay and cool, fun hotels, and not boring chains, it was a bit of a miss for me.    Good things    Vibe – cool, modern and hip. the lobby. Lots of use of raw concrete throughout the hotel. Great garden out front and plenty of plants on main floor in bar and restaurant  Food – Peruvian restaurant was EXCELLENT.  Service – Bar, Restaurant, Coffee shop had absolutely killer, great employees (check-in, not so much, they seem distracted by other duties at their computers). People I would hire in a heartbeat.    So-So    Room – small, with tiny but functional bath and great power and heat in the shower. Sink is across the entry hall and a little awkward to use (not a lot of room for my dop kit, toothbrush, etc. Bed is comfy, strange bench seat at small table is not comfortable.    Annoying    They have two bars; the lobby bar and the cantina. It’s a business trip, so I like to sit in the bar, have a drink and some apps and bang out emails on my laptop. HOWEVER, laptops not permitted in the cool cantina bar that serves food. Only in the lobby bar (boring, stale and no food) which was unfortunately closed.    Check-in was weird and time consuming. You have to do your own check-in on an ipad. So I have to type in a bunch of information, including my email on two different screens. Normally check in is hand over id and credit card and I’m done. Here I’m filling out 4 screens of ipad stuff, and get to the end and I get a generic error message. No real information, the app just puked. I eventually get the attention of an employee, whose response is 'i've never seen that before', so i get to start over. So not only do I have to do the work, it's not very efficient. I like the idea, but the execution needs work.    Hotel has a big stone entry and lovely gardens with seating - so unusual in NY, HOWEVER, it's not well marked, just a small 'public' with no street number. So my uber drive left me off a block from the hotel as he couldn't find it.    Area is SoHo (1 block south of Houston), but there didn't seem to be any cafe's, restaurants close to the hotel, I may have had to walk farther.    Lots of tagging graffiti and while I believe it is an area low on violent crime, we had some jokers come in and pull the fire alarm at 2am. So you get a few hundred ragged looking people wandering down the stairs from (11th floor for me) and hanging outside until the fire department cleared the building at 3:30 am. Not so much as a 'sorry about destroying your nights sleep' at check out the next morning, let alone a comp'ed coffee or breakfast.    Lastly, they do this lovely thing where that tack on a hidden 'Access Fee' to jack up the room price by $35, It supposedly pays for access to the clubs (closed on Monday when i'm there) and some other things that I don't see value in, but it's becoming more common - I think it's just sleazy. If you want more money for your hotel, put it in the price, don't hide it.    It was an interesting experience, but I won't be back.",-0.9226,1,2

I always request to be away from the elevator and other noisy gathering points but couldn't do so for this trip. We exited the elevator on our floor and there was our room. I was worried it would be super noisy. However, there aren't many rooms per floor so it wasn't an issue. We were on the 5th floor and could hear street noise. Pack earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  The room felt really dark (decor) and there weren't a lot of light  The room felt a bit careworn. It was clean but it might be time for a bit of a refresh.  Lots of towels but, alas, only 1 towel hook. I don't think I'll ever understand that.  The bathrooms have that annoying barn door style, which do a very poor job insulating sound. Because the room is very small, there's really no privacy so keep that in mind if traveling with people you might not be totally comfortable with.  I am not a fan of Times Square at all so the location of this hotel wasn't a favorite. It was convenient to Broadway shows, a bit out of the manin TS crush and an easy walk to Bryant Park though.  We didn't get breakfast because the lines were always really long. Plenty of good places to eat in Manhattan though. I did grab coffee, which is kept out all day.

However on leaving to go to the airport we were approached by the most miserable, rude doorman (who we hadn’t seen in the whole time we were there) & asked if we needed a taxi.

We arrived at this hotel after our travel company changed our hotel at the last minute. We arrived after a long journey. My booking was for my husband, myself and our teenage children. We had a booking for four rooms and we arrived at 8pm.    When we arrived at check in, they asked us to pay $375 per room. I’m not sure about you, but I don’t have that kind of money spare. When I said I couldn’t pay this, they said they would cancel my booking, even though I had paid upfront. We were not made aware of this and after checking the website again, it’s not mentioned anywhere on there. Also at 8pm at night one of our rooms were not ready. The first gentleman was very unhelpful, but thankfully Evelyn took over. She said if we couldn’t pay, they would cancel. Again I explained that we couldn’t afford to pay this. Seriously, who could!!! I explained that it was all my children and did we have to pay this for every room. Again, yes. She then said she would speak to her manager to see if she could reduce it to just the resort fee of $40 per night. Might not sound a lot now, but would still amount to $800 for my family. I am disgusted that they think this is ok. I dread to think of young people turning up here without a back up! Our options now were to pay the $800 or look for a new hotel at 8pm at night with our children in tow, pay for another room and then wait for a refund. So our only option really was to pay this. I just want to make everyone aware of this as we were now down a large chunk of our spending money for nothing! As our room wasn’t ready, we got one room upgraded. This was room 45/09. It has a nice view of Times Sq.    I am unsure what the resort fee was for as nothing was open.    I tried to speak to a manger again a couple of days later as had been trying to see if it was mentioned on website. It’s not and I asked her why. She just shrugged her shoulders. She was so unhelpful and very rude. Suppose that’s why she got the managers job. She told me to go check the paperwork, unfortunately I must have binned this in our room at some point.    Such a shame as our room was lovely. Good view, amazingly comfortable bed, clean room. Room cleaned daily and fresh towels daily. Lifts were always only a few seconds away.    Check in seems to take forever. There is always a queue and always very slow moving. This is also why I waited a few days to try to speak to someone again. Always too busy!    I heard many people moaning about this fee of $375, so not just me.    I wouldn’t stay here again because of this fee. Shame as good location. But who can afford to pay more than they paid on fees for a flight and room?",-0.8201,1,2

Not a big deal, unless you need an elevator. There are three elevators for all 44 floors of this hotel so you will be taking the stairs a fair bit. I winced at those who chose a high floor, we stayed on the fifth and took the stairs almost daily. We often had to wait in excess of 10 minutes for an elevator (which don't have A/C).  The rooms are smaller than you might expect, but they were very clean and well stocked with bathroom supplies. The beds are soft and the tv was a good size (around 40 inches). The room (we had a double), came with a tiny fridge-but it was enough to store a few drinks.  The on site gym is open 24 hours and has two treadmills, two ellipticals, a couple of bikes and a few weights, all in all, totally suitable for a workout.  The hotel is located within a block of a subway that can take you directly to Times Square in 15 minutes.  We were also warned of a possible wifi charge but did not get charged with that, even after a four night stay. This is possible due to the 4 hour long fire alarm that occurred on our third night, starting at 3am and went until 7:30am. There was no explanation as to why this happened, but since no one else evacuated the hotel we stayed in our rooms, assuming someone had smoked in their room and the fire alarm was broken. It made for a very unpleasant night. Another night we had someone decide to vacuum outside our room after 10pm, so that was also annoying, and a first for me (I stay at a lot of hotels for work).

Let's start with the positives. Almost all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was spacious, the beds were comfortable, and the linens were very nice. The location was excellent and close to the theater and Times Square. Unfortunately, that is pretty much where it ended.    The hotel itself looked quite dated, and even though we upgraded to the king suite, it too was very outdated. The furniture was very old and worn out. The toilet flush barely worked, and to our surprise, there were no wine glasses in the mini-bar. We had to call down to the front desk for some, but they never arrived, and we had to go down to the lobby to ask for them. They did indicate the wine glasses were supposed to be there, but maybe it was an oversight by housekeeping. The bath products provided were of poor quality. Additionally, there was no coffee or water in the room, which was surprising considering the high price we paid for our stay and the fact that it is a star-rated hotel. We paid around $650 for the night (and that did not include breakfast) and $90 for parking per night. We were there for 26 hours, so they charged us for 2 nights parking.    Overall, we would not recommend staying at the Michelangelo hotel in New York, as the lack of attention to detail in room amenities and outdated decor did not justify the high cost of the stay. We realize it's about supply and demand, and that could justify the cost, but it certainly does not justify the star rating.",-0.5165,1,0

That is not lost on me. To start off, this hotel is a perfectly fine hotel if you need to stay in FiDi. The room is decent size but the bathroom is tiny. I've stayed at hotels in NYC at similar price point with MUCH bigger bathrooms but I get that might have been more of an exception in NYC so no points off for the small bathroom. The room makes up for it with the large balcony which was really nice to have. With the exception of one lady at the front desk, the rest of the staff was exceptionally nice and welcoming.    Now, this is where I got really angry. You pay a fee each day that is supposed to cover water and coffee etc. Not once, did they refill the coffee pods or water bottles for the 3 nights that I was there (each day they made up the room). I called one day to get some water and creamer (used both creamers for one pod). On the third day, I called down because I ran out of coffee pods. The lady at the front desk said that it would be an extra charge. I told her this was ridiculous because they were never refilled. She said she would look into it and call me back. Really? 5 minutes later she called me back saying the system shows they replenished them but that they would send more and graciously waive the fee. The room comes with 2 caffeinated pods so for my stay I should have had 6 of them (if I used 2 per day) but I only used 2 the entire stay (the 2 that were in the room on the first day). She continued to explain that their system showed it was replenished, essentially saying that I was lying (there were no cups either since they were not replenished). Honestly, from a customer service perspective, I should NOT have to argue about getting a freaking coffee pod and convince them that I am not lying to save a couple bucks.    Again, I know I am complaining about a relatively small issue, but it was such a simple thing from a customer service perspective to not insinuate that the customer is lying and just send up 1 freaking coffee pod.    If I need to stay in FiDi again, I would likely not stay at this hotel. Such a shame that one bad customer service encounter can leave a foul taste in your mouth and ruin an otherwise nice stay.",-0.9866,1,0

They have a small rooftop pool with a swanky patio bar/resto which was nice, although got quite crowded later in the day. Due to it being on the roof the pool area was not as warm as it could be, and I feel the temp of the water should be raised accordingly. Also, there were times the whole patio would shut down if there were threats of thunder & lightning. One day, there were storms in the forecast but they never materialized but the hotel closed the pool anyway. This was devastating for my little one.

Since we live in Connecticut, and hate having to go home via a late night train, we decided to book a room at The Empire Hotel.  We've never stayed here before, and chose the place based on its extremely convenient location: it's basically just across the road from the Lincoln Center, and a very short walk from a few of our favourite restaurants. It has a bar on the roof, with bar food, but we didn't partake.  It's a nice old place - the entrance doors and lobby are inviting, and have an air of faded gentility (it's not often that I get a chance to use that phrase).  Check in was smooth enough, I suppose: we mentioned that our Met Opera Guild membership entitled us to late checkout, and were met with a blank stare. We overheard the lady standing next to us, showing her Met Opera Guild card, and asking for a discount. Looks like blank stares were in fashion.  Once we left the foyer, we found that some madman had redecorated the public areas, with wallpaper which resembled lots of blank picture frames: basically the perfect shape and colour to confuse a guest trying to find directions to his room.  Our room? Tiny, stuffy and lacking in basic amenities. It didn't even have a chair. I'll post a picture. It had been renovated, very badly: the sink was shallow, so that when you turned on the tap, it sprayed water all over your lap, the curtains didn't actually keep out the light. the light switches were crooked, the toilet tissue was mounted on the wall behind the toilet door (nice trick - it took us a while to find that one). There was only one bedside light. Bottom line - awful room.  Since we were staying only one night, I didn't rush off to the front desk to complain.  When we checked out, the guy on the desk winced, and said that we had booked an ""Express Room"". Apparently, these are crappy rooms, tucked into odd corners, to satisfy the needs of people who just need somewhere to spend the night, at short notice. He suggested that next time we visit, we ask for one of their other rooms.    So, bear that in mind if you want to stay here.",-0.7709,1,0

However, the rest, really disappointing, I rated as 3 stars, but realistically 2.5 would be more accurate. First room was on 2nd floor overlooking 47th street, was really noisy with traffic, car horns (many drivers do seem to love their horns in New York) along with the constant hum drifting down from Times Square. But worst of all was the pneumatic drills from work straight across the road, started at 7am, even one day kicking off at 6am. We had a blind that should have worked electronically on the one window in the room, but didn’t. It felt a bit like being in an inside room with no windows. When we reported it on a number of occasions there was a lukewarm response, with the “we’ll send someone up”. Eventually we were told they needed to call out a 3rd party, so we got moved to another room on a higher floor.    This turned out to be a slightly larger room and having seen some of the other rooms when doors open for cleaning, that looked like shoe boxes, we felt privileged.    An unbelievable down side in the rooms, no tea/coffee making facilities nor a fridge/mini fridge. I’ve stayed in many hotels and this is a first and such a huge inconvenience. I hate to think how difficult this makes it in the really hot summer months for residents.    Bathrooms a good size, but plain white tiles made it feel like school showers or I’d imagine a hostel. In the second room there was a vile smell from the drain in the bathroom with many small flies on the walls. When we put a towel over the drain this suppressed the smell and alleviated the fly problem. To our amazement it appeared that the maids were oblivious to this, removing the towel nor putting anything down the drain. We had to call management for this, which helped, temporarily.    No bar facilities in the hotel was another surprising negative.    We booked through a 3rd party website and to add insult to injury we were charged a $35 daily facility fee at checkout. Never any mention of this beforehand and what a joke. I did wonder why they took $350 dollars off my card just after checking in, very sneaky, be warned.    There were smaller daily local tourist taxes which I was expecting and had no issue with these.

While there were some positives about the hotel, I would not likely stay here again.    Pros:  The location is great. The hotel is walking distance to Times Square, The Empire State Building, and Grand Central Station.  There were plenty of nearby restaurants.  While the location is really good, it's far enough away from the touristy destinations to avoid some of the chaos.  The shower was amazing. I know, weird thing to write about, but the water pressure was fabulous.  The rooms are decent size for NYC.  Beds are fairly comfortable.    Cons:  The hotel is LOUD. And not like fun, full of energy. I mean poorly soundproofed. You can hear everything from the hallway and from the street. I know the hotel is old, but there might as well be no door on the rooms at all for how much sound carries. I've stayed in old hotels before. This was one of the worst for sound.  The rooms are TIRED. I mean seriously worn. The front panel of the AC unit was falling off, all of the tile grout is cracked and chipped, the furniture is super beat up, and all of the trim and moldings need to be replaced. The lobby looks freshly updated, but our room was in disrepair.  The hotel will not honor your room requests. We requested a quiet room on a high floor. We got a room on the 4th floor, facing Lexington, directly across from the housekeeping linen closets. It was literally the opposite of what we requested. I should have asked for a different room, but I was with my daughter and trying to keep it lighthearted and fun. We got NO SLEEP. The housekeeping staff accesses those linen closets all morning, and because there is no soundproofing on the rooms, there is no more sleeping once they get to work.  One afternoon we returned to our room and found that the housekeeping staff and changed our thermostat from 72 degrees down to 60 and put the fan on high. Maybe they do this to keep cool while they service the room? In any event, it was left this way, and we returned to a freezing cold room.  There is no onsite restaurant or bar. Looks like there used to be a rooftop option, but no longer. That was a bummer.    Long story short, the cons outweighed the pros for me. There are a ton of hotel options in this area. I would try something else and hope for a better experience.",-0.9158,1,0

We arrived at around 10pm, no help was offered with our luggage. My wife is 6 months pregnant and after travelling for 18 hours - I would have really appreciated some help with our bags - none was forthcoming.    The property itself is nice, although our room was tired. One of the wardrobes had a hole where bulbs were meant to be (so no light at all) the other wouldn’t close properly so shed a constant light into the room. The desk and bedside tables in the room had all seen better days and the lamp on the desk was bent and broken. The computer connections to the side of the desk (USB to charge phones/tablets) was broken. We had paid extra to have an ‘illy coffee machine’ - which was just a terrible cafetière and not as described.    The carpet is absolutely disgusting and we didn’t dare walk on it bare foot!    The ‘mini fridge’ is a domestic fridge which did not fit in the space adequately (obviously the cupboard was originally fitted with a hotel spec minibar). This meant that the door would catch on the inner of the cupboard every time you wanted to open it. Whilst the room was adequate, it simply is not good enough at this price point.    On a plus, the bathroom is excellent, the bed was comfy and the city view - spectacular!    Service;    Overall the service from this property was poor almost exclusively at every single touch point.    1 - I had emailed prior to arrival to ask a few questions - the reply was overly direct and set the tone for our upcoming stay.  2 - Check in was the only exception and the gentleman who checked us in was efficient and helpful but not overly friendly. We were not told about any relevant details (would we like to pay for breakfast for example)  3 - I had cause to wait in the lobby for a delivery - I asked the lady behind the desk if she had seen it arrive, she didn’t want to help. Whilst I waited, I witnessed 3 separate guests enquire about what time checkout was - the lady behind the desk was rude to every single one of them (if so many guests are asking the same question, this shows a lack of service at check in). She could not have made her displeasure at having to answer guests queries more obvious had she spat in their faces! She was dreadful and is definitely working in the wrong industry! (Management, if you are reading this it was 1830 on December 29th 2022).  4 - Several guests asked for late checkout and were rudely told ‘call back before 11am and speak to the manager’ - really quite unhelpful and unprofessional - not to mention unnecessarily rude!    Bar Service    1 - Service was slow and we were not made to feel very welcome. At one point one of the 2 barmen simply turned his back and walked away from me, even though I had been stood at the bar for 2-3 minutes and there were no other customers waiting to be served.  2 - The bar pricing is different to the advertised rates on the website (and the rates which we were emailed prior to arrival)  3 - The service was ‘ok’ and there was certainly no ‘service with a smile’ here!    Overall - the property is ‘OK’ and the location and views are great but the service was poor and this is what would stop me returning. Having spent my career working for two very large American companies who put the customer at the absolute heart of everything which they do - it was a great shame to see that the staff at this property were not doing this. Put simply, the service was ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’    A special mention to the housekeeping staff however - after a long day of sightseeing - it was lovely to come back to a clean room and their thank you note for being tipped a relatively small amount really meant a lot!",-0.8349,1,2

All of the staff here are wonderful. We had a ""1 King Bed"" room with a very comfortable mattress/pillow. The room is small, the showers in particular are beautiful but tiny and very odd....it's a fixed half-glass wall. The shower doesn't have a sliding door. It's impossible not to soak the floor in the area in front of the toilet just outside the shower, which is really annoying. My guess is the shower is so small in width that city building code wouldn't allow for a human to be in there with a sliding door closed. I noticed a lot of reviewers mention and show pictures of bathrobes, that must be a thing of the past. The real negative is the lack of sound-proofing in these rooms. Paper thin walls and doors that just have too much gap and no sound-proofing. You can hear conversations in the hallway as if the people were at the foot of your bed. Light from the hallway pours in around all 4 sides of the door. We used a towel for the 1""+ gap on the bottom because we could see people's feet in the hallway from bed. You can hear voices, alarms, phones ringing, etc of your neighbors. It's really quite remarkable how invasive and non-private it felt knowing people can hear everything you say and do in your room. I really don't know how this isn't mentioned in more reviews. It's really, really bad. What's funny was there was no sound disturbance from the street. Couldn't hear anything from the outside, sirens, trash trucks, all the usual NY city sounds were amazingly non-existent. But....I could hear the guy in the room next door chewing gum.

We got in line with the second desk clerk who was very accommodating and checked us in. I asked what the resort fee covered and was told “the gym”. There was complimentary water at the gym (water cooler and paper cups). Room was stylish but worn. Bed was comfortable. I asked about the mini bad and was told it had one and that it was an empty refrigerator- according to the person I spoke with that WAS the mini bar. Also, apparently breakfast was included in the daily resort fee, but no one told us that upon check in (we went out to breakfast each day of our stay). At one point, our room reeked of weed (someone in another room was smoking directly into a vent, I assume). The room was literally hazy. I called the front desk and they offered to move us if they couldn’t resolve the issue. It was late and we just went to bed.

I think that's on management.    There were also odd quirks with the room - the water pressure in the shower was not good at all and the design of the bathroom made it very hard to do hair and make-up. I dragged a chair in from the room but even then it was not easy. The outlets were located so that the cord from my hair dryer had to go over the sink and I was worried the whole time about the hair dryer and curlers slipping in. There was a full length mirror in the room but there were no outlets near by and lighting was not great. Those are all little things but definitely made getting ready for my meeting that much harder. Another quirk was the size of the bed which they said was a queen. I am not sure I believe that.    On the plus side, when I could not get internet they were eventually able to help.

Now it's just a building with a hotel rooms.,"I've been staying at this hotel since it first opened as a Hyatt and have stayed many, many times (more than 30x). I really liked the restaurant, the valet service, and the lounge service in the past. I know it's still the pandemic, but I didn't realize how much this place had changed. The restaurant is closed. There is no valet. There is no bellhop. We pulled up to the hotel by car and was told they didn't have a valet service anymore (they used to for almost 10 years). There was also no one to help with bags. Just a single guy sitting at the front desk behind a plexiglass shield. There is no lounge service. I paid a mandatory $40 fee for breakfast and afternoon wine & cheese. We asked about the wine and cheese after we arrived and were told there was no cheese but we could have some wine brought to our room - I guess that would be cool if we wanted to get plastered before dinner without food.The breakfast the following morning was coffee in the lobby (no decaf/no tea) with some 7/11-worthy pastries in plastic wrappers. There was one yogurt when I arrived (just after 9am on a Saturday). I asked if there was another given we are two in the room. Nope. My wife drinks tea and can't eat gluten so breakfast was a bust. The rooms are how I remember them but they don't do turndown service unless you ask them (apparently). Why do I have to ask? Doesn't everyone go to bed in the evening? The shampoos, conditioner and shower gel are large and reusable so not entirely cool in covid times. We checked out and waved bye-bye. I won't be back. It's really just building with rooms.

I’m a discerning consumer, and we usually stay at the Michelangelo on W 51st as it caters to families and offers spacious rooms at a decent price. However, I took a chance and booked here for a night with my daughter just before Christmas. I booked a ‘deluxe’ double room for a few hundred dollars for one night. Here is the lowdown...    Positives:    Location....very important, and this fits the bill if you want to be in proximity to Rockefeller, Times Square or various Broadway shows.    The breakfast next door was a little different and we liked the variety....pastries, french toast and even avocado toast. Definitely a step up from the usual continental offerings.    Negatives:    The room was standard, blah, nothing ‘deluxe’ about it to justify the pricing. We’ve had better at the Holiday Inn. Sure, a mini fridge and microwave were included, but isn’t that generally the standard at any hotel anymore? A bottle of Voss on the counter will set you back $8, and the main TV was small. The bathroom was a disaster and ill-conceived. Small counter, large toilet with 2 TP holders (one of which was right next to the bathtub). A small TV was in the bathroom, although it faced the toilet and made no sense for watching it anywhere else as the bathtub faucet was on the wrong side to view the TV while taking a bath. Detail obviously was overlooked when designing these rooms.    The advertised ‘24-hr snack and drink’ counter on 2nd floor is false advertising, as this was not open or stocked in the morning during our stay. Seems to be open at various times only. Or perhaps their staff just weren’t attentive to this.    The staff was polite, yet curt. For a hotel that seems to get such accolades, the interactions with the front desk and valet personnel came across as apathetic, bored and perhaps overwhelmed. Not impressed.    For a night, we survived. Live and learn, I suppose. Will be staying elsewhere next time. Just not enough here to warrant their star rating or have us as return customers.",-0.5833,1,0

The bellman pulled out his phone and called someone he knew at Yellow Taxi. The Yellow Taxi arrived and picked up my daughter and me for the ride to LGA. After we had traveled a few blocks, I noticed that the meter was off. When I asked the driver, he said LGA was a flat fare. I looked at the rate card in the cab and saw that it had a provision for a flat fare to JFK but not to LGA. When I asked the driver about that he said it was an expired rate card. The rate card has an expiration date of 31-Oct-2023. The driver was clearly lying and trying to charge me whatever he wanted. When I objected, he returned me to the hotel. I informed the front desk manager about the episode. The bellman disclaimed any knowledge of or responsibility for the cab driver's scam.    I know that the hotel is not technically responsible for the cab driver's actions, but a hotel departure experience like that leaves an impression that gets associated with the hotel.

Stayed for seven nights in a 9th floor king bed studio overlooking W56th. Average day rate over $950 - when much is given, much is expected.  The hotel is well situated in Midtown, the staff were pleasant and the room spacious by any standards. Bed comfortable, nice lounge area. But:  1. I specifically asked for a 'quiet room'. This was the noisiest room I have ever stayed in anywhere by far. Two giant air-con units on a level with the floor on the building opposite kept up a constant barrage plus traffic noise - sirens, horns, petrol-heads, speaker systems, garbage trucks - and construction. At night it was like trying to sleep in the street! Ear-plugs helped, but the windows in this room are seriously deficient in sound-proofing. Result: not one decent night's sleep.  2. The hospitality tray is poor - a coffee maker but no kettle, no fresh milk, no biscuits, carboard cups with stick stirrers. No mini-bar in the room. This is budget-level provision, not $1000 a day.  3. We requested a kettle but after 24 hours, nothing. So had to ask again. Why? Bulb failed in the lounge area but was not replaced. Screw in the bathroom door handle unit sticking out by about 50mm. I mentioned it to a member of staff. Days later nothing done.  4. Lighting in the room is dim throughout. It is hard to read in bed without eye-strain.  5. And whoever designed the street-level entrance on W56th must have had a failure of imagination - dull, unattractive. uninspiring.  Given the rather obvious cost-cutting, lack of attention to detail and poor quality sleep, I cannot recommend the Thompson Central Park at these prices (which incidentally does not adjoin CP). The nearby Peninsula and the Trump International are, or were, far better (and the Trump actually is adjacent to Central Park).",-0.9791,1,0

We had a standard room that was fairly spacious, view of a brick wall from window so felt very dark. Bed very comfortable, enough storage, a small sofa and desk and chair. AC/heating was easy to adjust. Bathroom had a huge circular bath, would have taken ages to fill, so used the overhead shower. I felt it could possibly be an issue for some people to step in and out of, as no handles. Hot water was quick and nice toiletries provided, although no robes or slippers. No drawback was lack of tea/coffee making facilities, again I expect taken from rooms due to pandemic. As there is currently no open bar, restaurant or room service in the hotel, I think they should have provided coffee in reception area. We asked for a kettle which was delivered very quickly, though short lead meant we had to put in on floor so not particularly safe.  Hope bar/restaurant opens soon, but there are plenty of eateries nearby including The Red Flame diner across the road which do great breakfasts.

We ended up walking the stairs quite a bit but it was difficult to accomplish this with luggage on the day we checked out. The breakfast was ok. There were 2 breakfast areas. One on the main floor and one in the basement which was odd. One evening we had picked up a pizza from a pizza place just a little way down from the hotel. We decided to eat it all together in the breakfast/bar area because other than sitting on the bed there wasn’t enough room for all of us to eat and there were tables to sit at. The bar wasn’t open the entire time we were there (and having a glass of wine after a long day of sightseeing would have been nice). We had paper plates, napkins and bottles of water the pizza place provided us. We were all sitting quietly eating (in a empty bar room) and a hotel employee got quite rude telling us we were not allowed to eat in there. I told him we would clean up after ourselves and we were almost finished and he told us to hurry up and left us to finish. The other problem I had was that I paid for both rooms.

But the biggest affects staying here at the UWS Jazz hostel.    Booked a 2-bed dorm and got one on the top floor. I live in a walk up and only brought a carry on, so stairs as the only option up was no issue for me. The problem is: the weather follows you inside.    Unlike the four lower floors below it, the 5th floor had no radiator in the hallway (building regulations, maybe, or the building’s age), so it’s chilly outside the dorm.  Making matters worse, the vent in the toilet room is always on and powerful. Yes, this prevents offensive odors from building up, but the temperature of the air depends on the temperature outside. That means it’s freezing should you need to use the toilet. Also, the extreme shift in air pressure made it difficult to close the door for privacy.  Finally, while it was temperate in the dorm, especially in bed, it was cold at the desk by the window. Why? They left the air conditioner in the window and the cold air from outside was getting in.    Everything else went well. I was checked in quickly despite my late arrival. I kept my small things (i.e. toiletries) in an unlocked locker and nobody (dormmate or housekeeping) messed with them.  One more wrinkle, however, was the free WiFi. I connected easily in the lobby. But, once I returned all the way up to my dorm, it dropped out. The network was visible, but my smartphone refused to connect.

New, nice decor, nice touches.  But - it falls short as an airport hotel. I stayed here twice when I needed a hotel near the airport, but only because I had Hyatt points. If I was paying I would not choose this as an airport hotel. First, there is no shuttle. I’ve never stayed at other airport hotels that do not have some kind of shuttle service. Second, the food offering is poor for those who might arrive late or leave early. There is no 24-hour room service (I arrived at around 1am, so this mattered). Room service only starts at 11am so if you want breakfast, it’s get to the club lounge or grab something like a bagel/fruit salad from the Starbucks/grab and go (which is 24 hours I believe). Third, the actual restaurants all seem to be in the casino complex next door which is a pain if you just want to go down from your room to eat something. There’s nothing else in walking distance. Probably a great hotel if you’re there for gambling.    Also weirdly Uber/Lyft (see: lack of shuttle) get confused by the address and keep wanting to take you somewhere round the back (closed gates so no can do).

I called as soon as I got home and realized it, but of course they said they didn’t have it.

Our room was on the 8th floor.  We had hoped for a relaxing couple of days in New York. However, on the first night the fire alarm went off at 3.40am on our floor. I called reception and was told ""if you don't feel safe in your room come down to the lobby”, What a strange thing to tell a guest on the 8th floor with a fire alarm going off.  We decided to check the fire exit plan which is normally on the back of the hotel room door but unfortunately there was none on our door, so we didn’t know where the stairs were on our floor.  It was very scary to hear the fire engine sirens approaching as we walked down the stairwell to the lobby. If there had been smoke in the corridors, we would not have known which way the fire exit was. We noticed as we descended past each floor, the fire alarm was not sounding on floors 6 through 1, only on 7 and 8,  In the lobby there were lots of firemen and the fire truck outside. There did not seem to be many guests – just a handful. The receptionist did not know how to turn the alarm off. No one from the hotel seemed to be taking charge. No one was coordinating getting guests out of their rooms. We were in the lobby for about half an hour and guests were still coming down the stairs.  It was quite evident the Fire Officer was not happy at all with the situation as the hotel staff on duty did not seem to have a plan to evacuate all the guests. Later that morning while talking to other guests, they were unaware of the situation as there were not on floor 7 or 8.  Another point to make was that the bedroom doors in the hotel are fire doors and should close automatically. Ours did not close by itself and we had to close it each time we came and went. Only 3 days earlier 17 people lost their lives in an apartment block fire in the Bronx, the fire officers said a huge contribution to that fire was a fire door which did not close properly. Our situation could have been so much more serious. We are very thankful to still be here.  We very disappointed that Fitzpatrick’s hotel did not seem to have a plan to evacuate their guests or to have trained their staff in what to do if there is a fire.

The very rude girl on the other end told me that there were towels in the room and asked me if I had SEEN them. We were sent one old bath towel, a hand towel, and a washcloth. Breakfast is decent but there aren't enough seats and the woman who was taking care of the area was complaining in Spanish while she working.

Noticed my sons front door was terribly bowed from handle to top with a 1cm gap allowing sound from lifts opposite to enter room. Doors closed with a bang at all times of am & pm.... was rather miffed at noisy people slamming doors till I realised they had to be slammed shut to fully close. First night we all unpacked into drawers & wardrobes as we had 5nights stay. Then late into the night when all was quiet we heard a constant banging in roof of our bathroom. Strange we thought when we were in room 1516 on top floor. When bathroom door was closed & we put a towel at bottom the banging was muffled & being from the Uk & shattered we slept ok (as your midnight was our 5am) this noise continued for our whole stay & despite telling reception & they having maintenance look into it we were told they had ‘no idea’ where it was coming from. We even had a maintenance man in our room at 9pm when we asked again what the noise was. We were offered to move but the inconvenience of moving & packing up & not being next to our boys would have been worse than the aggravation of this noise whilst in the bathroom which was annoying. The next day this maintenance man just shrugged his shoulders & said no idea! I’ll leave a video of the noise. (I cannot leave a video I’ve tried!! If anyone knows how I can let me know) The cold coming from the windows made the room feel very cold & the heat when put on made it too hot within minutes. So i plumped for putting bath towels on the window sill which seemed to somewhat stop the draft at night. The beds were comfortable & the rooms were clean. I just don’t suggest staying in room 1516 or there abouts because of this noise. The reception staff were polite & adjusted our bill slightly because of this annoyance which we were grateful that they at least acknowledged we had a problem. The hotel is in a good position.

However.. on the final day and going to check out at 8am we waited for 50 minutes with our cases outside the lift.

One evening the reception expressed annoyance when I told her there was a guest in the lobby who was not wearing a face covering. She did nothing about it.

Was really looking forward to going to New York again!,"We got the Holiday package through British Airways , Hotel and flight , the flight was ok but when we arrived at JFK British Airways lost my checked in luggage, they said I would get it in a couple of days, that was 2 hours extra spent in the Airport that was not a great start, we eventually got to the Sheraton hotel rather late and was greeted by an oriental looking male member of staff at reception check in ! For some reason the man was barely civil and looked totally in a mood , not a smile in sight, I will say after that the rest of the staff were awesome, the rooms were adequate and reasonable, when we arrived we knew it would be cold but without my suitcase wasn’t prepared for the ice storm that hit the state of New York, the real feel was -28 with the breeze, after two days of this I decided to contact BA about my suitcase, the chat bot gave me case tracking info, to which told me it was lost, when asked BA said I could buy clothes but be reasonable and keep your receipts, I spent nearly £500 which in New York is nothing as it is now the most expensive city in the world, for example a pint of Guinness 10-11 Dollars a pint, if you go for a meal, there is government tax added and on top of that a 20 % tip on top added to your bill so everything was very expensive which probably explains why I have never ever seen as many homeless people in my life, most of these unfortunate people live in the subway, the problem seems to have become far worse since the Covid pandemic , the smell of marajuana and urine intermittently fill the air , regarding my suitcase the hotel was as helpful as they could be as for BA nobody ever rang me to ask how I was doing without my case, I had the case delivered to my home address the week after I got back, I have six weeks after still not been reimbursed for the money I spent on clothes and had no form of compensation, they did initially say in a rare email that they would reimburse me but have not done so! They also offered me a fifty pound voucher, but as I would never fly with this uncaring airline again it would be a waste of time, before the pandemic I went with Virgin and had a great time, I must say that I probably wouldn’t go to New York again and I would definitely never fly with British airways again.",-0.9105,1,0

The guy on the front desk was less than average - provided us with absolutely no information when we checked in. Did not know what time to check out, where the laundry facilities were, etc. There is also no compendium in the room to give information about the hotel and nearby facilities. He basically gave us our keys (which were physical keys, not key cards) and that was it.    The room suited us well for the 5 nights that we stayed there, and its proximity to Times Square and subway stations was fantastic. However, Friday & Saturday nights, bring ear plugs or don't expect to get any sleep. The noise from bars below as well as crowds and traffic for Times Square was insane (and we were on the 10th floor!) The other alternative is that you go and join the madness below so then you are kept awake.    Laundry facilities are in the basement free of charge to guests. HOWEVER, they're only able to be used between 8pm and 8am because these are the washers used by the cleaning staff to clean the bedding and towels. The timing was super inconvenient for us.  We asked for house keeping only one of the days that we were there and it was also below average. Towels got replaced, but sheets were not changed, dishes were not washed that we had in the sink. We had left a tip so we expected more to have been done. There are separate window air con in the bedroom and the lounge which are very noisy and the hotel 'hums' when these are turned off, so I would not recommend this place to anyone who is a light or sensitive sleeper.    All in all, the only thing saving this hotel is its location and relative cheap price compared to other hotels in the area. The building is older with solid walls and floors so no noise from other apartments. There are 2 elevators and they take forever to get you anywhere. Leave your room a few minutes earlier if you need to be anywhere in a hurry!

The shared areas are well maintained. The rooms were quiet and no sound of road noise or a city going to work.

There was often chaos happening and frustrated guests as we went in and out - so you need to be organized and aware of times as you check out or it will disappoint.

The staff that were great was the security man that always met you with a smile , the porter who was wonderful and the maintenance man who bought us a heater - so Thank-you . The main staff reception require lessons in good manners, good grace , customer service and humility . My complaint regarding someone opening our door with a key after midnight was met with disdain . When I rang to find out the outcome I was told he had sent up security and that someone had mistakenly opened door - after repeating my complaint that someone actually had a key and it was unacceptable they had access to our room he dealt with it by over speaking - he was arrogant and fobbed me off - he finally asked what I wanted and I said to be reassured so he rudely offered to shift us - however it was 1.15 am and I felt this was more stressful . He said he would write it down in the book - two days later and no mention of apology - so if like me you are part of a group of women traveling and you want to feel you are safe then this property was a huge disappointment to me .

I will start with the positives first.  The hotel staff are so friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and cleaned daily by really friendly domestic staff. The hotel was ideally situated and close to Penn Station , Times Square and shows and eateries. We never encountered any issues with the lifts at all, longest we waited was approx 3 minutes and travelled at Peak and off Peak times. They have times to avoid on the lift. We stayed on floor 23.  The aircon worked well , kept the toom cool just a little noisy which is something I can accept to be cool. There is an ice machine on all floors.  We didn't hear any noises from the room next door , you could hear street noise even on floor 23 but it is NYC so you expect it.  Now for the negative parts.  The rooms are super small but again it is NYC , our issue was the sliding bathroom door, it was ridiculous and provided no privacy as also had a frosted glass door so with the light on you could see what the person was doing, this we did not like. The shower temperature was terrible in the 6 nights I had 3 ice cold showers it wouldn't warm up.  The homeless folk were no issue at all apart from one occasion a man screamed at me to get out of New York you F**King B***h again this didn't bother me at all I get they have issues and we're all drinking it didn't bother the kids either. The hotel did a good job whilst we were there to keep it clean so no complaints, they cannot control it as it is a public area and they have to sleep somewhere.

The bathroom in the room in which we stayed was not clean - superficially perhaps but there was mold in the grouting and the bathtub was really dangerous.

Need better sound proofing on windows. Also our “upgraded” room did not have a bathroom door! This is a very poor design flaw and was a real negative to our stay.    - room service was very poor.

The main room was practically the same, but this meant that the door to the bathroom was sliding and could not lock. Moreover, the shower was open, so water evidently leaked all over the rest of the bathroom, making it extremely difficult to use for the rest of the duration of our stay. There were also some issues with the number of rooms given to us, as we had booked 2 and were only given 1 at first. The elevators were also, for me, quite a significant logistical issue, as there are only a few elevators for the entire hotel to use, so there’s is always a wait to use them. This can be very tedious if in a rush. It was also quite difficult to remember to bring a keycard (which is required to use the elevators) every time you wanted to go up or down somewhere, and was a particular problem with a large family.

The good: a wonderful front desk staffer who lit up the world with a smile, and at check-in was just lovely. I wish I'd gotten her name. And when on the second morning I asked housekeeping to refresh towels (they were at the door of an adjacent room), they said ""We'll just service the whole thing if that's all right,"" and of course it was. The view from my corner room was east to St. Patrick's Cathedral, which is a fine view indeed! The location can't be beat: far enough from Times Square that it's not overwhelmed with foot traffic, but a half block from 5th Ave and a block from a subway stop at Radio City Music Hall.    The unhappy, at nearly $300 a night: the room had no ""work surface"" (industry jargon). I DO think a desk or something similar is required by Doubletree brand standards. I ended up working from my bed, a pillow plopped on my lap.  The room was so filled with the scent of some overwhelming room 'freshener' that my eyes stung when I first walked in. And a day after leaving I'm still smelling that disgusting scent on the clothes I'm putting in the washer. That scent was noticeably stronger each time the AC kicked on, so I'm wondering if they had something in there to keep the room 'fresh.'  The bathroom shower leaked all over the floor each morning (thus the need for more towels to mop up water).  The in-house hotel charged $4.50 for a second cup of coffee, and the prices in that restaurant were usurious for 'meh' food. The service was also unfriendly and disinterested. I ate there my first morning, but wouldn't go back.  I asked before check-out to speak to a manager to share these concerns -- I had already spoken to front desk about the stinging eyes and the scent -- but was told a manager was not in.

A curious layout with reception on 6th floor with a bar really didn’t work to me. Reception desk staff seemed disengaged generally. Our double Queen set up and bathroom were okay but furniture was tired with knocks to woodwork etc unrepaired. The bathroom looked to be more recently modernized on face of it but clearly poorly maintained. First night’s sleep broken by persistently leaking and dripping shower. Following morning we asked for it to be fixed whilst out for day. However after a second night kept awake with same shower problem it seemed apparent the requested maintenance hadn’t been performed. On return to room that evening our room had not be cleaned or made up and shower remained unfixed so we had to revert to reception to ask to be moved to a different room - always a pest when u r all unpacked. The second room made us realize that the shower problem in the first room created a very weak shower experience in comparison! No further problems with second room. Breakfast experience was one not to be repeated either and we only had breakfast in hotel restaurant once as a result. The venue for breakfast was incredibly dark and more like a bar atmosphere. Whilst the food was ok a side order was missed and we needed to request again which then appeared late after other food finished. However - the worst was a staff member who in full view of the room placed his hand down his trousers to rearrange his nether regions before immediately putting on his apron and then proceeding to handle clean cutlery into receptacles. Revolting behaviour. Hence we ate out for rest of stay for breakfast.,-0.9422,1,0

Close to lots of transport options, especially port authority. Our room was ready when we arrived and that was a real bonus. The room itself was spacious with comfortable beds, plenty storage space and hot water with good shower pressure. You have to request housekeeping which we did most days on others we asked for clean towels and the bin emptied. It was noisy at night as we were on the 4th floor I would recommend a higher floor. Also the smell of weed from people smoking out front was notiecable in the room. But it was everywhere anyway so no avoiding it and not the hotels fault.  We had booked on a bed and breakfast basis. Honestly don't it was a joke!!!. First morning we had issues when trying to explain we had alreay paid. We were given the limited choices and to be honest Ive been to New York 8 times and this was the poorest breakfast ever. But that wasnt the real issue.  It honestly went downhill from here. It was very confrontational the next two mornings. A different staff member, who was rude, and actually called us crazy. We went to reception to speak to them to ensure breakfast staff were aware of our B&B booking and to say how intimidated this guy made us feel. Banging about being very intimidating. The response was we will update the breakfast staff as you are not on the list and inform the manager of your concerns. Whilst at reception the breakfast guy came over and was rude again. To top it all the next morning my friend asked for the parfait to be told there were none left and whilst sitting eating our pastries watched other guests recieve the parfait. My advice would be avoid the breakfast altogether. We have never encoutered attitude like this in New York before and for 2 women travelling alone it wasn't great.  We were unable to ay to keep our room as the hotel was full that night but the luggage guy stored our cases and booked our airport transfer. He was by far the most helpful, pleasant staff member we encountered.  We stayed for 6 nights and if it had been a less confrontational visit then we would probably have stayed again.  8th visit to New York and it wont be my last. Its an amazing place.",-0.7418,1,0

The room (king size) was very nice and clean. The bed is very big and comfortable and also the bathroom was nice.  Room is small but cozy. The only negative aspect was that there was no wardrobe.  Breakfast was included but it was very poor. After the first day we always had breakfast outside.  One very negative point was after the check in:  A different room type was given to us and we have been informed about this only after that we went to reception to complain. Apparently the type of room we booked was no longer available. We complained and we managed to switch the day after. I understand that these things can happen but the receptionist should tell it to the guests upfront and not only after that they complain when they find out. I was told that this room was actually more expensive but too me it looked much worse than the one I reserved and with a smaller bed.    The location of the hotel is good as not far away from main touristic attractions.

Housecleaning was poor, room was not done in a good way, no refill of nespresso, and if we asked for something it was not fixed, only after a couple of inquiries.

The lobby is dark and kind of gloomy-not bright as it appears on the website.    The room is small, but possibly not by NY standards. Was clean and modern with operable windows.    Worth noting, though there’s probably nothing that can be done. Terrible design of the bathroom sink. The faucet isn’t high enough so that when washing your hands, there’s no way to avoid hitting the bottom of the faucet which is just kind of icky. I would move my hands away from the faucet when lathering up, but even so, it was really difficult to avoid hitting the spigot when rinsing.

We were told at check-in that if we want to retrieve our car from the parking, we need to give them a half an hour notice in advance. during our three nights stay, one days my car retrieval took more than an hour and we were late to our soccer game. I placed the order with the front desk staff at 7am to retrieve my car from parking. I made sure I told him to get it in time because we had soccer game and he kept saying yes yes no problem. we went to breakfast and came back. The car was not there yet. I asked him he said it’s coming it’s coming and then 40 minutes past. I asked him again then he double check the system then he said oh he did not put the order through because I took the card back. Instead of apologizing, he was blaming it on me that he did not order the retrieval of the car from the parking. Then he put the order through and it took another 20 minutes to get the car. During this waiting time we had to get a taxi for our soccer players to get them to field for their game. It cost us about $50 for the taxi. That was extra cost that we could have used to get lunch for our kids.    During check-out the front desk staff did not give me a receipt. He just said everything will be sent to your email but I was suspicious so I asked him for my receipt because I want to check it. he gave me the receipt I saw he charged me for 6 nights parking instead of 3 nights and parking is not cheap $73 for SUV. I had to dispute that but the front desk staff didn’t know what to do or how to check, again, he started blaming me that I might have taken my car during the day couple times then I told him I made sure I only took my car once so I should be getting charged once a day only not twice a day. then the manager walked in and she had to check the system. She checked the report and found I should be charged only 3 nights parking not 6 nights. I think this extra charges were not an accident. They meant to do that. Because I caught them, they were kind of upset. the manager raised her voice, and she was saying to sit down, relax and wait, when I clearly explain to her that we had to go. We had a soccer game we cannot wait. This was very rude from the manager. She raised her voice on me when she was supposed to apologize for their mistake.

Had it not been for these crucially bad design choices we would have rated this hotel a 4+ instead of about 3.1.    What makes this worse was that the failings weren’t due to trying to save money. All of the problems with our room could have been avoided without spending any material additional amounts of money.    The Bedroom    The Good:    The room was decent sized, clean, with lots of light. The bed was comfortable. The TV was good and well placed. The A/C worked. The fridge worked. There were USB plugs easily available.    The Bad:    —Too Hot    There was only a sheet and a heavy comforter. That meant we had to set the A/C to 68 to cool the room enough to sleep under the heavy comforter. Every hour or so it would come on full blast for about 10 minutes. Not pleasant. If they had put a spread or thin blanket on the bed we could have removed the comforter and skipped running the A/C all night.    —No Drawers    This was a very BIG deal!    The only drawer in the entire room was a very tiny one in one night table apparently only included to hold a bible, which we put on the floor so that we could use the drawer for something worthwhile.    There were NO other drawers in the room. Two people staying in NYC in early Fall for eight days and there was no place put our stuff.    After a couple of days, the room looked like there had been an explosion in a dry cleaners.    It wouldn’t have cost Marriott materially any more money to install a dresser with 6 drawers instead of the very long table with NO drawers that they did use. And, how about two night tables with two or three drawers each instead of the two night tables without any drawers (well the one tiny Bible drawer).    —Tiny Closet    The closet was ONE FOOT wide. They could have made the drawer-less table that abutted the closet one foot shorter and at least given us a two foot wide closet so that we could have hung up our clothes.    —No Microwave    There was a slot under the drawer-less table for a microwave and a plug for it, but it had been removed. When we wanted to heat up take-out food or a leftover we had to get on the elevator, go to the “breakfast” area near the lobby, heat up the food in the microwave there, and then carry it back up to the room.    —Almost No Electric Plugs    the room had USB connectors. Good. But if you had to plug in a camera charger or a hair dryer or something else that needed a real electric plug you were in trouble. I think there was one available outlet (2 plugs) in the bedroom in an awkward location and one in the bathroom.    There are still lots of things in the world that do NOT run on USB power.    The Ugly    The door to the room was at least two inches thick, solid core and super-heavily sprung. Entering the room felt like pushing through the door on a bank vault. An old person would have been unable to open that door from the outside.    Seriously, it took a lot of force to push it open and enter the room. If you had left your frail grandmother alone inside that room it’s questionable if she would have been able to get out again.    The Bathroom    The Good    The bathroom was big, clean, and well lit. The walk-in shower was huge. Water temp and pressure were good.    The Bad    —No Nightlight In The Bathroom    You’ve heard of dancing in the dark – good. But peeing in the dark? No so much.    When you get to a certain age you have to get up at least once each night to pee. Sad but true. To pee at night you have to be able to see the toilet.    The bathroom was as dark as the bottom of a coal mine. So, at 3:00 am you had to stumble in, close the door almost but not quite all the way (more on that later) and turn on the very bright interior light. You had to close the door so that the light did not disturb your partner.    After you blasted your eyeballs with the fluorescents, you then could pee. Then you had to open the door a tiny crack, turn off the light, then fully open the door and return to bed.    One little nightlight would have solved this problem. If I had stumbled on a hardware store early in our stay I would have bought one myself and left it there as a gift for the next guest.    The Ugly    —The Door Of Doom    The bathroom “door” was a slab of solid wood at least two-inches thick, almost seven feet high and at least six feet long. It hung from the ceiling on a track like a barn door and must have weighed well over 500 pounds. It took a lot of effort to move it, and it wasn’t silent.    There was no latch on the inside of the door so you could not lock it from the inside to keep someone from inadvertently entering while you were on the toilet.    But far, far worse than that was the fact that there was no handle on the inside. If you foolishly closed the door all the way, you could not get out of the bathroom.    My girlfriend was trapped in the bathroom twice! One time she was stuck in there for about fifteen minutes while I was out on an errand. “Let me out,” she called when I struggled my way through the bank-vault front door.    If someone was traveling alone and they had scheduled housekeeping for every other day they could have been trapped in that bathroom for a very long time.    Insanity!    —No Towel Racks    Two people in a room use at least a face towel and a bath towel each – 4 towels. So, it makes sense that there would be towel racks sufficient to hold four towels, right? No. Only one small fixture with two protrusions. At most you could hang two towels from it.    —A Soap Opera    The shampoo, body wash, etc. was contained in fat bottles permanently affixed to the shower wall. That would have been OK except that the bottles had tiny, tiny spouts that made it almost impossible to dispense the soap from them onto a luffa or even into the palm of your hand.    A small, round, cheap squeeze bottle that could have been pulled out of a rack and turned upside down to squeeze the liquid into the luffa or your palm would have worked great. These bottles – really hard to use.    —The Cold & Slippery Floor    There were no rugs at all anywhere in the room or the bathroom. I’m OK with that, but you want a textile mat of some sort (1) in front of the sink, (2) in front of the toilet, and (3) at the exit to the shower so that you can dry your feet. Wet feet slip on ceramic. Dry feet on a mat don’t slip.    And, let’s face it, if you’re sitting on the can or standing at the sink it’s nice to have a towel or something between your feet and the cold ceramic floor.    Marriott could have secured a two velcro strips to the floor in each of these three areas and supplied three towel-like pieces of material that would have adhered to the velcro in each area, yet could have been pulled away from the velcro by the maids and thrown in the wash.    The Lobby    When we arrived we were greeted with the sounds of jackhammers. The hotel is (early October, 2022) in the midst of a conversion from Fairfield Suites to a Courtyard. Most of the lobby is closed off and under construction. Morning to night it was filled with the very loud sounds of heavy construction.    Because of the construction the hot breakfast promised on the website description was also MIA. Apples, cereal and muffins were pretty much it.",-0.5154,1,2

Just a quick one night in the city, so we selected based on location and price. We generally stay at Residence Inn or Courtyards and this Fairfield was a bit of step down in terms of service from those hotels. Perhaps it's just that this is such a large hotel? Here were our issues:    - Room booked for two people, arrived to find ONE set of towels in the room. We both wanted to shower on arrival after a long drive and my husband (over 6 ft tall) had to dry off with a hand towel because more towels still had not been delivered an hour after our arrival and complaint. A single additional towel was delivered at some point in the evening while we were out. I can understand extra towels taking a while to deliver, but when you don't provide enough towels for the individuals booked to stay in the room the delivery should be faster.    - The sink drain is unlike any I've ever seen. We were convinced it was broken! Maybe we don't get out enough, but you have to push the drain to get it to pop up. Okay - so maybe the maid should leave it in the down position? We had a gross sink of water before we got that one sorted out with the front desk.    - Allow plenty of time to get your vehicle returned from valet parking. We called ahead 15 minutes before going down and still waited another 15 min or more for the car to arrive.    Overall and okay stay. I hate to be picky and complain, but the towel thing really was annoying. Breakfast buffet was decent, paper plates and plastic ware, but food was okay.",-0.9015,1,0

My partner wants me to give it a one, but I'm trying to be realistic -- we're talking about Manhattan hotels, after all. Finding a hotel under $300 a night that isn't infested with bugs is a win, so we all need to be realistic with our reviews.    We stayed in the small room -- just big enough for a double bed, on the third floor, with the window looking out over a quiet little backyard.    The good:  No bugs, pretty clean (things normally out of site weren't clean, like under the bed or the side of the mini fridge, but everything visible was kept very clean), there's a microwave & minifridge in the room, the room is logically laid out so that the small size was manageable, no street noise, room looks like the pictures, bedding is crisp and comfortable, mattress was alright.    The bad:  Mainly our problem was the heat. We were booked in a very small room (room 31), & we're okay with small spaces, but when the radiator is on, that very small, enclosed space heats up to insane temperatures, and you can't open the window! It was actually in the 90s in the room, and it was like trying to sleep in a sauna. We were drenched in sweat & had headaches & couldn't sleep the first two nights, & my makeup, on the opposite side of the room from the radiator, melted. It was so bad that we actually slept with our hotel room door opened the first two nights to get a bit of air, which obviously is not safe, and also it means you hear every creak and movement.    We were there for three nights and asked them FOUR times that the situation with the heat be taken care of. We understood that the heat can't be controlled in individual rooms, ie if it's turned down in our room, it's turned down for everyone (other people were not as bothered because their rooms were more spacious, so more air flow), so we suggested that either the window be fixed so that it could open (it had been jammed shut), or we be moved to a different room with a window that opens.    We were running into a wall of no response until finally we came back late on the third and final night and found our window had been opened. It was so nice, we were actually able to sleep that last night! And with our hotel room door closed!    I'm angry that it took so long to get a response about the situation, that my stuff melted, that we slept so poorly for two nights, that we had to unsafely leave our hotel room door open (and had no privacy), and that this situation was even a thing in the first place. We actually got engaged on this trip, & it really sucks that the hotel made us exhausted and a bit grumpy.    Other problems with the hotel:  There are a couple people who live in the hotel, and the one right next to our room was kind of a sourpuss. We crossed paths on the way to the bathroom on the first evening and I smiled at her and she grumbled and glared and mumbled some stuff under her breath. She was hostile, and my partner and I were left standing there like, what just happened?? She was also fond of opening her door to yell down the stairs to reception. It was just generally unpleasant to be next to her.    Also, there's one bathroom/shower on each floor, and the third floor shower had no hot water. My partner stuck it out and kept having cold showers; I didn't bother and just used the second floor bathroom, which was always hot, but it meant I was stealing the bathroom from the second floor.    Also, there's this odd little box in the bathrooms that periodically sprays out very perfumy air freshener, and being in the room next to the bathroom, it didn't help with the headaches. It's such a nasty chemical smell that spills on to everything.    A note about the neighbourhood -- don't underestimate how far it really is from everything. There's lots of great food walking distance (Amy Ruth's and Cantina!), but it's otherwise not a neighbourhood that's great for hanging out in, so you're going to be trecking out to other places on the subway or in a cab, and it does take time from up there.    In the end I'm giving this place three stars. I appreciate that it was affordable (for Manhattan standards) and kept clean (also by Manhattan standards). It would have been two stars but they did get it together and got the window opened on the third night.",-0.6601,1,2

You could probably (maybe) find something about the same with a slightly bigger room closer to Time Square that’s packed with tourists, etc. (in my experience) but I had no problems with room size. The room was clean and I loved how there were ample plug ins for our electronics and the bathroom was a decent size.    The only thing that I had some issues with was the air conditioning unit that didn’t function properly initially (it started to “magically” work in the middle of the night and gave us no problems after that) and I’m not sure what schedule the cleaning crew works but for some odd reason, I was constantly hearing vacuum sounds late at night.    Our room was on the 2nd floor so we didn’t have to walk up but one flight of stairs. To be honest, I couldn’t imagine having to walk up anything higher. Not necessarily out of laziness but more so after a long day of walking, etc. I just could barely find it in me to climb even the one flight of stairs to get to the room. Much less carry luggage up and down if needed to. The lack of even a small elevator could be frustrating.    The employees were all very friendly and didn’t run into anyone who didn’t have a smile on their face.    The only frustrating thing I had a complaint about was that as a non-smoker, there were a few times were some people weren’t courteous and were standing in the stairs into the entrance.    I would stay here again with no problems, just would pray I wouldn’t get a room no higher than the second floor.

Once we checked in however, everything was smooth, we were given room number 2807 which had a view to a construction site of a new building. No fault to the Edition, but not a favorable view. I suggest that if you are staying in this hotel in early 2023, you stay on the other side for a more favorable view. The room however was very nice, no complaints at all; the bathrobes are spectacular.    The next morning we decided to have brunch. Well, to summarize it, it took them about 30 minutes to take our order, and then we waited over an hour to get our food. Once the food arrived, it was cold, completely cold. I had ordered Avocado toast, my wife the skirt steak. There were three gentleman in suits, in addition to the waiters. Two of the gentleman came over to apologize; we told both of them that the food was cold and that we waited for over an hour. The crazy thing is that I saw another couple arrive 20 minutes after us, and they received their Avocado toast before us.    In any case, the first gentleman told us that he would not charge us for the breakfast, and a few minutes later the second gentleman came by to offer us champagne, which I declined, but my wife did take the glass. After we finished eating (yes we ate the cold food because we wasted almost two hours, were hungry and did not have breakfast), the check was brought to us by the second gentleman, and he said the drinks were on the house, that was two coffees and a special cocktail that had suggested to my wife. However, the breakfast was not credited, as promised by the first gentleman.    In the late afternoon, we had tea in the public bar area downstairs, and we decided to have dinner at a nearby restaurant. I went back upstairs to drop off some things that we had bought and noticed that our room door was slightly open. At first I thought, how could I possibly have left this open, but then I saw that that turn-down service had been in the room, and they obviously failed to close the door properly.    I did mention the security issue to the front desk and they apologized. I did not complain about being charged for lunch, it wasn’t about the money, so not being charge wouldn’t have fixed the fact that we waited over an hour, only to receive cold food. But I am writing this somewhat negative review because there are obviously flaws in the overall management in this hotel. Things go wrong, mistakes happen, it is human nature. But what’s important is how mistakes are being handled and corrected. In this case, I do not believe that they were handled correctly, and there is definitely some sort of mismanagement.    New York has many choices of hotels, unfortunately I must say that I would not stay at this property again.",-0.9796,1,2

While the staff are very nice,  the service is minimal. This hotel is expensive, over-rated & poorly laid out.    There is no one to greet you—no doorperson, no bellperson, no valet.  The lobby can only be reached by going down a long flight of outdoor stairs & crossing a courtyard or going into a small vestibule, taking a tiny, rickety elevator & walking down an ugly service hallway. The lobby is cramped & has over-loud music playing. The elevators to reach the rooms are down yet another ugly hallway & are somewhat claustrophobic.    The valet parking service is very expensive & requires someone to call from the front desk, although they were fairly quick to pick up & deliver the car.  If you drive & are checking in alone,  you will have to risk being ticketed &/or towed because you have to leave the car in a loading zone next to a bus stop.    The room was also cramped & was poorly lit. The beds are very comfortable, but nothing else is. Even the flat screen tv is small. The inadequate bathroom area is at least bright, but the sliding door to the even smaller toilet/shower area lacks a bottom runner & bangs loudly whenever opened or closed. Not pleasant for anyone else trying to sleep.    The room had not been thoroughly cleaned. My daughter found a plastic toy spider just under the bed when she bent over to tie her sneakers.    The continental breakfast ($15),  available in the little store in the miniscule lobby, included 1 bagel/english muffin/danish, 1 fruit, 1 yoghurt (they did let me exchange the yoghurt for a tiny milk). There were no choices with protein other than the milk or yoghurt, not even hard-boiled eggs.    There are much more comfortable, reasonably priced options, with much better accomodations & services.

The location was perfect for what I needed and fit into the budget. If you were wondering as I was before booking, TownePlace Suites and Springhill Suites are together in one 46-story building. There is one check-in desk. The elevators are shared, and so is breakfast.    The Good:  The hotel still new, everything was in good condition. The elevators have digital buttons, and the in-room flat screens are very large. It was nice to have a small fridge, microwave and kitchen basics. The staff was very friendly, and the room was very clean.    The Not Wonderful:  The bathroom has a sliding barn door, and it kept sliding open when closed, as if it wasn't level. This wasn't a big deal since I was by myself, but certainly could have been awkward if sharing with another person. The hot water also seemed to be spotty. At times getting hot water in the shower was reasonable with a wait, but one shower there seemed to be hardly any hot water at all. The room is very small, but this is expected in New York City. It's fine for a single person, but would be very difficult for a family.    The Really Not Great:  The elevators. Plan for significantly long waits in the morning. My first morning, I waited more than 15 minutes before I was able to catch an elevator going up (to eventually go down). The wait at off-times was fine, but frustrating when you have scheduled business meetings in the morning.    The breakfast area is definitely small for the number of people in the building. It was a standard breakfast you would find in similar Fairfield/Residence Inn branded hotels. There was hot sausage, scrambled eggs, cereal, muffins, toast, etc. My first morning I grabbed a bagel and yogurt. The bagel was obviously stale when I took it apart, but worst the yogurt was sour. I was terrified I was going to get sick from one bite of the yogurt, but luckily was not. I ate at a local Starbucks on my other two mornings.    Overall, there were ups and downs.

The staff were fine--not friendly, but also not rude (just ""there"" and definitely seemed overwhelmed at times).    The main issue is the elevator situation--it's completely unacceptable. 10-15 min waits were the norm, elevators were usually at capacity. It was so bad that I regularly took the stairs from the 21st floor (after waiting several minutes and beat the elevators down). A colleague had to haul her bags from the 6th floor via the stairs just to get out of there in a reasonable time for a meeting and checkout. It also disrupts service--I regularly heard housekeepers and cleaners complaining about the elevators (and actually ran into some of them in the stairs hauling trash bags because it was faster--and they felt sorry for the poor ladies with carts who were stressed trying to find any elevator actually use). One of the four elevators have been down for weeks at least (based on recent reviews), but even without that issue there is clearly a design flaw--the hotel isn't that large to have these elevator problems. They should be segmented by floors or have other smart routing capabilities built it. To run the hotel at near capacity with horrible elevator service is a disservice to guests.",-0.9294,1,0

The ""hallway"" outside the room was about 5 feet wide and 10 feet long? So it was a very very enclosed space. Which leads us to...    The clientele wasn't great. For example, the people next door to us were extremely loud and combative. It seemed like everything they could slam, they did, and you could hear them arguing and it made us uneasy. One night around 2AM they came back and we were awoken to what sounded like someone trying to ram their door open. I think their door got stuck like ours but instead of just pushing hard it sounded like they were either throwing their body against it or kicking it open.

We have stayed at this property before without issues as it is perfectly located in walking distance to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and Times Square. Additionally, it is a safe neighborhood across from the police precinct. I had given my wife Billy Joel tickets for her birthday and 2 daughters tickets as a Christmas present, so paid for two rooms. We were given room 213 and 215. Check in went smoothly, both rooms were fine and we went out to the theater for a matinee. Upon returning, my daughters room 215 was 80 degrees as the AC not working on a 90 degree plus NYC day. Our room 213 was fine at 67 degrees. We notified the front desk who notified the MOD. We were told it was due to being out of the room for 3 hours and the motion sensor shuts down the AC if no movement.. However, it did not come back on when they entered the room and 213 did not experience any rise in temperature. We asked to switch 215 for a different room but the MOD said none were available and instead offered 10000 points for the trouble. We did not find that satisfactory so I called corporate but was told I needed to work it out with the manager at the hotel. They said there was nothing that they could do. We went back to the day MOD and requested engineering to look at the thermostat and please fix it before we returned from dinner and the Billy Joel concert. We were out of both rooms from 6pm to 11 pm.    Upon returning, the room temperatures were exactly the same as earlier-213 was 67 degrees and 215 was 80 degrees. The night MOD said the day MOD had left a post it note with the night MOD to tell my daughters to crack a window if the temperature was high. Totally unsatisfactory answer given the windows open on to a roof top with hot ventilation exhaust and the temp was still above 80 outside. We again asked for a room change from 215 and told the night MOD was told the hotel was sold out. I went on the Bonvoy app to book another room for the same night at the Chelsea and saw 3 rooms available, but the night MOD said even with a confirmation number, he would have to take us to another property. We asked for a fan and told none were available. We insisted on a solution and the night MOD said he was overwhelmed, but offered to comp me for room 215 which did not help my daughters. The MOD did find or call in an engineer to look at the problem who told us is 54 degrees in the duct work which did not help as the room was still 80 so suspect the fan was not working. The engineer said he found a part 'in the basement' that might help but it did not help. It was well after midnight and after standing at the lobby desk for over an hour, all of a sudden room 504 became available? My daughters repacked and moved upstairs.

It's close to Grand Central and other notable sites. We recently stayed there during a visit to watch the US Open. I can't stress how great the location was (and how great most of the staff were). But, as a concept hotel goes, I question the concept. The overall stay was mediocre. Let me explain why.    Upon arrival, we had to go find an employee to check us in (i guess the concept is that no one is standing in the lobby, lol). He started the process and then said he'd be right back. He then disappeared for 10 minutes, until we went and found another employee and asked where our person went. They asked and then told us he was talking to the manager. Um, okay.... Then the manager came out and said the room was not ready due to a cleaning mishap (despite us getting an email saying it was ready, and we arrived at 6:30 pm). The solution, they put us in a temporary room (and then moved use when we were at the US Open). So off to a rocky start.    The room was large and spacious, but felt empty. There was one small round table, a very long sofa, and a desk. Despite all this space, there were no luggage stands. So all the luggage went on the sofa. The TV mount was crooked (super annoying if you have OCD, lol). Finally, there were two phones in the room with massive LCD screens. They literally lite up the room at night.    Despite submitting my preferences on when we wanted our room cleaned (I selected afternoons), the first morning there was a cleaning service knock on the door at 10 am. This happened again the next day. So much for taking the time to complete the preferences email.    Let's talk in-room dining. This was the biggest disappointment. The food was not bad (although it was a bit too salty for my taste). However, for someone with a gluten and dairy allergy the menu was severely limited. The only thing my wife could eat for dinner was a hamburger with lettuce for a bun, and a modified beet salad. They had no gluten free bread products. The menu is just really poorly planned out for allergies. I've stayed a tons of hotels, and it's not that hard to design a modification friendly menu that serves the needs of all. Hell, just having a salad option with chicken would be a simple first step. (But when we asked if we could modify some of the items, we were told the kitchen doesn't allow modifications.) For a higher-end hotel, this was unacceptable.",-0.9561,1,0

She proceeded to “thump” the keyboard of the computer in a very aggressive manner, sighing constantly, she then rose and started using the computer at the reception desk, very odd behaviour indeed. She returned to her room, slamming the door In the process, she returned to said computer and sat down again with aggression, I had a slight cough which was done with my mouth closed when she turned on me saying “how rude, cover your mouth, rant, rant, rant” By now I’d had enough of her attention seeking behaviour and swiftly restored telling her I have an incurable lung condition and is not at all contagious, I was very angry at her rudeness and very bad attitude.

That makes it quite convenient for easy access to many attractions. You can walk within 5 minutes to Macy’s on 35th street, or it’s about 15 minutes up to Central Park at 59th street. There are many restaurants around the area and easy access to the broadway theatres.  The room was very quiet as the hotel is between broadway, and 6th, which are both very noisy with traffic - especially the siren traffic! The bed was very comfortable and the room was kept quite clean. The check in staff were very friendly and helpful.  However, despite these positive points we were in fact disappointed with our choice of hotel. When you enter the hotel you have a pleasant check in desk area. However there is virtually no breakfast service. There is a light cafe at the back of the check in zone but only offers light coffee, tea, or pastries. At night it’s worse. The “ bar” is a selection of beers,wines,and some spirits, laid out on the counter and these are quickly removed by 10.00pm, assuming it opens at all! Sometimes it doesn’t open! Therefore the evening atmosphere is not exciting.  The elevators are pretty old and slow, and the hotel elevator zones at each floor badly need a makeover. The bathroom in the bedroom was very old basic standard with mainly painted walls. There was mould on the shower floor between the tiles and in the corner of the shower. No shower gel supplied - only a bar of soap, some shampoo and conditioner.  By contrast we visited our usual hotel a few blocks up and realised we had made a big mistake this time. The other hotel is actually cheaper in price but has a vibrant entrance area, bar, restaurant and is much more exciting.

The only observation that I will make about the neighborhood is that even though you are away from the chaos of Time Square, the neighborhoods leading up to times Square are not the nicest. This is the first time back to NY in 10 years, and I believe the hoodlums and homeless on the street is worse. With the legalization of Marijuana, it’s not an exaggeration to say that you will smell it on every block and see it being sold on the street by peddlers.

On the few occasions we went up it was empty and felt a bit eerie. There is a bar, which isn't stocked or staffed.    As for the room - it was too small. My feet were hanging off the bed and we had to tiptoe around our cases due to lack of floor space. Within 5 minutes of coming into the room it turned into a sweatbox due to the small space. The only alternative was to put the A/C on which then made it freezing. On the plus side we didn't have any problems with noise from other guests.    Another disappointment was the area. I appreciate this isn't the doing of the hotel but I just didn't feel entirely comfortable. 22nd is in the middle of Chelsea which still has that dodgy vibe that carries down from the Penn Station area. I think Chelsea is way overrated in general. There were a number of suspicious characters hanging around the corner from the front door. One morning we witnessed some guy abusing and threatening to beat up his girlfriend a few blocks uptown from the hotel. We also saw another tourist being harassed by a street hustler outside Joe's Pizza, which is a 2minute walk from the hotel. It was only a few blocks further towards Greenwich Village that the area felt safer. Not necessarily the hotel's fault but still worth bearing in mind.    All in all, it was a decent experience.

What I was not prepared for is just how depressing staying here is right now. Upon check-in was “upgraded” from a Wonderful to a Spectacular room. The room is taller than it is long or wide making it feel cold and hollow. On one wall there is a a multicolored headboard and wall that is reminiscent of Legoland and on the other there is a stark white wall that is reminiscent of a prison cell. There is one window in the corner with no drape, only a blackout curtain. This leaves the option of being completely exposed to the other buildings or being in darkness. This room is not spectacular, wonderful, wow, or any of the corporate branding W has at this point. The carpet is in dire shape, and the bathroom is on par with a Hampton Inn on the side of the highway. The hallways are dismal and sad. Waiting for the elevator on my floor gives me that creepy feeling as I’m in a bad neighborhood. This is at best, a Four Points by Sheraton right now and Marriott would do well to kill off the W branding for the time being. It’s laughable and downright criminal what this hotel charges for a nightly rate. This should not be a W, Marriott, or even a Sheraton.

Paying for leaving your luggage. We left our luggage for 2 hours, paying 10 dollars for 2 small bags. Even when it's family run. It's called customer service. The argument that somebody has to especially be there to watch it, as there is no special space for it, is ridiculous. Just put it behind a locked door. When I told them it was quite outrageous to ask money for it. I was considered rude! I knew these 'RULES' beforehand. But they will stop me coming back. 3.

There was a paid wireless internet service available but we did not use it since we were all days out in the city.

As a result, I made the decision to spend MUCH more than I normally would for the 5 week stay and chose a Sonder corporate apartment largely because their cancellation policy would allow for a full refund of the booking up to 3 days before it's scheduled beginning. The booking itself was fraught with difficulties as initially Sonder required me to do a BACKGROUND check to make the reservation which required me to upload all my financial information to a 3rd party website. I made it clear I wasn't comfortable with that and ended up prepaying for the entire stay to avoid it. There were other booking issues including a strange spontaneous cancellation of my booking that I had to call to have reinstated.    As it turned out, my business trip was not canceled and I arrived to find a very worn, small corporate apartment that was not well cleaned and had multiple maintenance issues. In particular, the heat was on full blast when I arrived (it was over 80 in the apt), the refrigerator smelled like spoiled food, the bed sheets had dead insects on them, and the shower drain was blocked. There were no instructions on the heater and I ended up having to call Sonder to have them walk me through how to turn it down (I'm a frequent traveler and have NEVER had this issue). As it turned out, the heater continued to misbehave and required me to call the building maintenance (who were very nice) to fix it. The largest issue came when it looked like my trip was going to be cut short after 2 weeks of the 5 week stay. I wanted to contact Sonder about shortening my stay, but received no response to multiple email and App contacts about this. As soon as I'd ask the question, the person on the other end of the chat would stop responding. After 3 days of this I went through the phone tree and actually tried to talk to a human... which took quite a while. The very nice representative on the other end was not able to answer the question and said they'd check with their superiors and get back to me. I was eventually told that I could check out early, but that I'd receive NO refund, and in fact, would be charged a $250 fee for the early check out. Wait...

This review relates to our stay and may differ from the readers' experience. We do not glamorise poor accommodation or service and only relate the facts minus emotion so the reader can share what we experienced.    After an expensive and around the town taxi ride from the airport where our driver got lost, we finally arrived at this small budget style hotel late in the evening, the staff were okay but not over friendly. We had room 1404 which had a view onto the main street. On some of the nights, it got quite noisy especially when the nightclub opposite vacated around 4.30 am. The noise from the club exit was quite bad and continued for over an hour. Police were in attendance to prevent any trouble I guess and sleep was not an option anymore.    The room we booked had its own toilet and shower but some rooms are a shared bathroom and toilet arrangement. Room housekeeping is only 3 times per week but you have sufficient bathroom items and can request more if you run out.    The rooms are small, a little tired, old and could use some TLC, but like most of this style of accommodation we visited we felt they are just a cash cow for the owners and almost a backpackers, but because you are in New York you pay a premium.    The bathroom was small but okay it had a few broken tiles in the shower and the grout was a little grubby the shower was low pressure but got the job done. The two single beds were reasonably comfortable but the air conditioning was an old style set in the wall. The rooms were hot and the air conditioner struggled to cool the room and was very noisy.    You can get tea and coffee from the downstairs ground floor machine as there are no facilities in the rooms nor are there any breakfast options.  The hotel was okay for a couple of days and in a convenient location close the Metro, buses, a supermarket, cafes, and bars if you need them and the hotel is set close to some interesting places to visit.  There are better options if you are on a low travel budget.",-0.9122,1,0

The amenities offered in the room were basic, 1 pack of coffee granules and 1 pack of decaf, absolutely no tea which was frustrating. However you could take the lift down 16 floors if you wanted tea but the two lifts were very slow and you could end up stopping at nearly every floor that the tea almost wasn't worth it.

Also, and I can't be 100% sure about this but we got the impression some rooms/floors are being used for social housing. No problem with that if that's the case, but frequently the lift was delayed as these people were using it to only go one floor up or down rather than use the stairs. If this is the case then it's not fair on paying guests. We were often delayed by 10-15 minutes.

An extremely slow trickle was also how the sink worked in my dorm's bathroom. More water leaked onto the floor than flowed into the sink for the simple task of washing my hands. At least there were no issues with the shower. As for the toilet, the handle was loose and needed to be pulled carefully and securely each time.

Our room was in the 4th floor and I believe was renovated some 20 years ago; Frayed and stained carpet, no table and only 1 folding chair even though there is a basic kitchen and utensils (where are you supposed to eat, on the desk? or in bed?). We asked for a table and it took 2 days to get one.  Another con: the apartment is located on a very busy corner so the noise was unbearable sometimes because the windows are so old fashion that you may feel you are sleeping in the middle of the intersection.

He freaked out and jumped up and started screaming at me that he was going to bash my effing head in if I didn’t get back in my room (I had only been in the hallway for about 5 seconds) Then he physically attacked me and shoved me into my room and slammed my door. I’m sure he woke up the entire floor.    The next day upon checkout, I told the front desk guy. He seemed completely indifferent and muttered something like “Huh...ok...I’ll talk to him about that”.

Check-in-The front desk staff was somewhat condescending about providing information about my accommodations. I was given room 306, which turned out to be one of the smallest and noisiest rooms. It is almost directly above the front entrance and faces the street. Late or night or early in the morning, I would be disturbed by people talking, very loud arguments, car alarms and garbage trucks. Small room-There is approx. 4 feet separating my bed from the other bed. I’m a light sleeper, so I’m quite sensitive to a lot of noise preventing me from getting to sleep. I could hear people doing a lot of walking (their heels) above me. I thought this was strange if they had a room the same size as mine! The air conditioner in the room worked well. My room had a stack of 5 really small lockers bolted in place. It’s a room for 2 people, why not have 2 medium sized lockers that can hold a laptop computer and more? The little lockers were not adequate for much (passport, wallet, small camera, not my laptop!!). The single beds (smaller than standard single beds) were adequate. I had no issues with theft.    The kitchen is in the basement, so I had to go up and down 4 flights of stairs constantly. The only people that had it worse were the people on the 4th floor. Bathrooms-There are 3 bathrooms on each floor for approx 12 rooms of 2 people each or 24 people, yet 1 bathroom is woman-only. Since woman use the co-ed bathrooms, but men can’t use the woman-only bathroom, this is not appropriate. The women have access to more bathrooms than the men. All 3 bathrooms should be available to everyone. The bathrooms were generally clean, although the showers were better in some bathrooms than others. Despite the people to bathroom ratio, I only had to wait for a bathroom twice (I got up between 9-930am), and the second time, since I was checking out, found a available bathroom on the first floor (with a crappy shower). The kitchen area was lacking in metal cutlery, drinking glasses and coffee mugs. When I arrived there were 3 mugs, midway into my stay, people took them to their rooms and didn’t return them. There were 3 TVs in the basement, 2 with digital cable receivers. They were adequate. Unsecure Wi-Fi internet access was in the lobby & basement. The Wi-Fi access speed was fine, but the security should have been WPA or WPA2. There are 3 computers in the basement for internet access, 20 min for $10US I think. It’s easy to meet fellow travelers in the basement. Check-out was quick & smooth. The hostel is on a hill, 1 block from the B/C subway lines. There is a medium-sized grocery store 3 streets South down Manhattan St. and 1 street East on 100th. Across the street from the hostel and at Manhattan & 100th is a little grocery store where you can get hot food. The area around the hostel seems to be frequented by Hispanic businesses and is safe.  On one night, the bed next to mine was vacant. The next night (following morning, 5am) the staff assigned the vacant bed to a Russian couple. They woke me up at 5 when they brought in their luggage, then to take out stuff to shower, then later a laptop to find other accommodations. The couple screwed up, thinking they would pay the single person fee for 2 people, so they didn’t pay and left at 10am. Why did the staff give the other bed in my room to 2 people, causing me to lose sleep for nothing? This was a bad decision on the staff’s part. I’ve been in third world countries, seen some awful living conditions and stayed at some crappy hotels. I rate this hotel as average for it’s class of hotel and price.

Central Park is also a minute's walk in the same direction and the American Museum of Natural History was a pleasant 20 minute walk away. As for downtown New York, it only took about 15 minutes to get there by subway. There's also loads of places to eat about five minutes walk away on the nearby avenue (sorry, forgotten the name) in the opposite direction to Central Park.    As for the hostel itself, the rooms were clean. Although the sheets weren't cleaned every day of my stay, I wasn't too bothered. I was out and about in NY so much that I wasn't too bothered about the problems with the rooms. One problem was the blinds were broken so they let in quite a lot of street light at night. Also, the lockers in the room are incredibly small - definitely not big enough for a laptop - and they'd benefit from some that you could put backpacks in. As it was, I chose to trust the only other person in my 6-bed dorm and put my laptop under my pillow. It was still there each day. Also, female guests have access to a locked female-only bathroom, which was a good idea. The bathroom next to my room was clean with two showers. There's wireless internet available and three computers in the lounge downstairs with payed internet access for those without laptops.    In terms of the staff, I only ever met one. I can't remember his name but he proved to be very friendly, perhaps overly so. During the night, our fire alarm batteries died and it started beeping. I went downstairs to get more but didn't get much luck. Instead, this guy decided to come into our room to fix it and didn't bother listening to me when I said it just needed new batteries. He left it to beep all night and, after saying he'd get someone to fix it the next day, I came back and found it was still beeping. That's when I went downstairs and, surprise surprise, it was the same guy and asked yet again for some batteries, which I was given and the problem was fixed. Quite annoying at the time. The one thing I would say about this guy is he needs to be sorted out. He let himself into a female-dorm at midnight with two girls (myself included) sleeping in there, sat on my bed and started stroking my face, hands, etc. I told him to get out and he eventually did. This guy shouldn't be working in a hostel - he's a creep.    But, in balance, this hostel was too good to let one moron ruin it.

First I emailed before our arrival for a few request. We have stayed here a couple of times , and I knew what I needed. I asked for a mini fridge, extra pillow, and towels, and not by an elevator. I didn’t receive any response from the hotel.  When we arrived, a room was ready, by the elevator. However there wasn’t any noise so it’s ok. The room is big lots of nice seating. The bad, well one the horrible light in the bathroom that you can’t stop turning on. It’s action activated and in the middle of the night the whole room lights up. The shower, good pressure, hot water, but no place to put stuff, no shelf for shampoo and body wash but on the floor. There isn’t a dresser, only nightstands for drawers and cubbyholes in the closet.  My reservation through Expedia, included a $15 raid the fridge per night, I’ll see if I’m charged. It also included a street view. That didn’t happen, only courtyard. Also no resort fee, hmm resort fee is common in Chicago , but not any resorts. I had another booking in June for this hotel but I am going to cancel. The little things, the non response, just didn’t do it for me.",-0.5124,1,2

This primarily economy-conscious business traveler hotel, has cut all services and hospitality to the bone in an effort to generate margins on volume. For context this reviewer spent >90 nights year travelling domestically and internationally pre-COVID. LQI provides 2 star accommodations and service with bloated nightly rates and outrageous add-ons including an adjacent parking lot averaging $50/night (if not pre-purchasing with SpotHero app).  The grumpy, intoxicated day-time front desk clerk was verbally abusive of a colleague during our check-in, could not bring themself to acknowledge or greet guests when entering or leaving and begrudgingly handed out additional toiletry supplies when requested.  Consistent with many other budget hotels, room services has been ELIMINATED. And as a consequence, so has room maintenance. During a three day stay we had to request plumbing assistance on two occasions (blocked tub and sink), additional towels (2 thin and worn-out small bath towels provided on check-in) and trash removal when the single small can was over-flowing. The window blinds were partially detached resulting in streaming morning light from 5am.  As noted by other recent reviewers, the limited breakfast service is a veritable disaster. Valiant efforts by a very short staffed dining hall team to cater to a drove of complaining guests in a mosh-pit of a cramped cafeteria, were to no avail. Between the tasteless prepackaged items and the coffee dregs, an Omicron super-spreader experience was all that was guaranteed.  So the positives? West loop location should be a pro but for $20 more per room per night, opt for a property closer to Mag mile and the lake.",-0.7655,1,0

The housekeeping staff were very nice and accomodating with limited resources. The hotel, as large as it is, does not have an area where taxis can line up. A lot of Ubers get called.

The cons: The full size bunk beds, bolted to the wall, are very uncomfortable and claustrophibic for adults. When sharing a bed, the one closest to the wall has to climb over the other adult to get out to use restroom, etc. There is no handrail in the bathroom. Breakfast is not included. The property is very noisy. The room was serviced very late despite multiple requests. It is fine for younger people perhaps but even my 22 and 19 year olds thought it was uncomfortable too.

I had made a reservation well in advance for a room with two double beds. However, upon our arrival, we were informed that the hotel had overbooked and the room we had reserved was not available. Instead, they offered us a room with a single king-size bed and a sofa bed.    The receptionist who checked us was courteous and even offered to arrange a room for us in a different hotel. However, after a long and exhausting journey with kids, we were already tired and late, and the prospect of further delays and inconvenience made us reluctantly accept the inadequate room we were offered.    The sofa bed was far from comfortable and not what we had in mind for a good night's rest. It's disappointing that the hotel didn't take their responsibility to honor our reservation seriously, leaving us with an uncomfortable and inadequate sleeping arrangement.    The real letdown, however, was when I approached the manager the next day to voice my concerns. Rather than showing any empathy or taking responsibility for the inconvenience we experienced, the manager simply brushed off the issue and told me that they operate on a ""first come, first served"" basis. This response was both disheartening and unsatisfactory, especially considering the situation was due to their own booking mismanagement.    I understand that things don't always go as planned, but a reputable hotel should be prepared to handle such situations with grace and professionalism. Offering a room that doesn't match the reservation and then shrugging off the problem when it's brought to their attention is simply unacceptable. I would caution anyone considering staying at this hotel to be prepared for the possibility of not getting what they've reserved and to not expect any meaningful resolution from the management if issues arise. This experience left a sour taste in my mouth, and I'll certainly be looking elsewhere for accommodations in the future.",-0.5632,1,0

But… room service was a sad experience.    Because my leg was hurting, I decided to forgo the restaurant and eat in the room. The room service menu was sorta sad - seemed like mainly pub food (remember we are talking about a Hilton here), and nothing really sounded good.    But, needing dinner, I finally decided on something and called room service to order. Then, the person answering said they had a number of “specials” - and voila, there were the items you’d expect at a Hilton - prime rib, salmon, roast chicken etc. I decided on one of these specials, was told it would be 35-40 min (which was reasonable and fine).    About 35 min later, a knock at the door. There stands a man who looked like he might be an Uber delivery man with a plastic bag in his hands, holding a plastic container with my meal (resting at a slant in the bag), and a roll with napkin and cutlery (thankfully not plastic). Luckily the sauce from the order had not spilled all over the bag yet.    Gone was the room service person dressed as from the restaurant, with a cart with meal on china, covered, set nicely with cutlery, salt and pepper, a glass of water, on a linen tablecloth.

The phone rang 40 times and no one answered, making placing an order impossible.  --There was a line to eat in the restaurant that was 20+ deep.  --(Abandoning the restaurant wait), we grabbed food to go in the coffee shop; there was also a long line and a staff member doing every task, from ringing out to making coffee to hearing sandwiches.    Our room was clean, but disappointing. I have stayed in this hotel with some regularity since starting business travel around 2005. It hasn't changed. That means about 15+ years without a major renovation. It shows. Decor is bland and brown. Fixtures and such are worn. Etc.    And, our room was uncomfortable. It was a cold night in Chicago (not unusual)! The entire window was covered in frozen condensation. On the INSIDE. Thus the room was cold despite the heat being on.

This was the first hotel that I have stayed in that had no hairdryer!! I had to buy one to use as the front desk said that they didn't have one. Location was good except at a really inconvenient intersection requiring a driver to go around a block to drive north. Really inconvenient. Got lost several times. Front desk staff very courteous which made it worth the stay. The continental breakfast was the usual.",-0.5274,1,0

Shortly thereafter, additional wedding guests arrived (17 in total) to eat breakfast and there was no food available. This is not usual of any other Hyatt House/Place hotel and is an extreme disappointment. Someone came out and said she would bring more pancakes and bacon but no eggs. All four bottle of syrup were completely empty and not replaced. For the next hour, we all watched an incredible amount of dissatisfied guests who expected to eat breakfast, however, left in dismay as there was no food available and then were informed that there would be no additional food available except pancakes and bacon. The fruit bar was empty except one lonely orange in the container. I texted the phone number “text the hotel” that appears on the Hyatt app informing the hotel that there are dozens of guests waiting for breakfast. There was no response.  Additionally, I texted the same number directly from the Hyatt app requesting additional linens and there was no response.  The hotel is very nice and quite typical of Hyatt House hotels, however, with such a poor breakfast experience, I would recommend arriving to breakfast early.    One additional note: while the breakfast is subpar or non-existent, I would be remiss if I failed to mention how friendly and hospitable the staff is. The Front Desk staff is amazing and provided great suggestions on food, transportation, and other requests.

We called to ask for a rollaway and were told this was against fire code policy for the room we were in. After trying to make this work and being unable to, we finally went in person & spoke to the evening front desk manager, voicing our concerns. She was kind enough to switch rooms for us, which allowed the space for a rollaway bed.  However, on the first night, we were given an air mattress, which we discovered had a leak in it during the night. The next morning, on our second day, I called the front desk and told them that the air mattress was faulty and they ended up bringing in a rollaway bed. This hotel was very good at coming up with options to fix problems, but for the amount this room cost, it was unfortunate that these problems existed to begin with.    The bed situation was our main concern, but I have some other concerns to also elavate. The wifi kept cutting out of the room and was not user friendly, especially with laptops as one of us was trying to work and could not get stable connection. The first room we were in had a broken mini fridge, and the air conditioning did not work properly. The second room was better in those regards, but the TV wasn’t working so they had to have an engineer come up to our room to fix it. The hotel also doesn’t have ice machines, so we requested ice from a gentleman but it was never brought to the room.    All this to be said, I want to once again state the employees were very nice and really tried to help us, so this was no one’s individual fault.

By this time there were about 8 of us stuck in here and I am having a panic attack. When we got let out the man scolded us about going through the door (he was not nice at all). Telling us to read the sign on door. All I saw was exit and stairs. He claims it says no re entry, but I did not want to re enter I wanted to go down. Did not know this was not possible.

Her behavior was downright disgusting and a poor reflection of the hotel and the city of Chicago in general.

I have a room during the COVID-era, so please keep that in mind about my review.    The hotel is in a good location (except not the safest to walk alone at night alone) and isn't expensive. The A/C was responsive. The check-in woman was friendly. It's relatively quiet (I'm on a high floor).    That said, there are a number of areas in which I have been disappointed:    (1) the floor is dirty. I walked around in my hotel room a brand new pair of socks right after arriving. The socks quickly became dirty. The floor is dirty, as is the floor of the closet. Also, in just one day I've already seen a flying insect and a spider. Not what I expected since there is no open window.    (2) The ""seal"" on the hotel room door to indicate the room has been sanitized isn't a seal, as suggested. Instead, it's a removable sticker that doesn't break when you open the door. That doesn't assure me the room is clean.    (3) The sheet covering the foot of the bed was dirty upon arrival.    (4) As part of their COVID protections (which I did not explained on their website before coming), they are not cleaning the rooms while you stay; that's not a problem in and of itself, as I understand why and many hotels are doing the same, but they also ensure they will provide a trash bag in each room so you can have your trash disposed of. They don't, unless you call for it. Not a big deal, but not highly quality service.    (5) I requested more coffee for the room and TP upon arrival (there was only one roll of TP, unsealed, in the bathroom, and only 1 pod of caffeinated coffee). I got these items rather quickly, along with the trash bag. But I got a single pod of coffee and a another single roll of toilet paper. This time the TP was wrapped but not sealed.    (6) The room is small.    (7) The bed is lumpy and uncomfortable. I wake up sore.    (8) In the bathroom, there is a single hook outside the shower, so all of our towels are lumped together there, making it harder for them to dry. Placing another hook or two would take about 15 minutes, in my experience. No reason there is a single hook on a relatively wide wall.    Overall, I wouldn't choose to stay here again. Disappointed.

I booked a Park,Stay,Fly package as I had an early flights and also needed parking. The hotel itself is excellent--great two room suites, large showers with Aveda bathroom products, and a nice pool area with with sauna, whirlpool, and gym.    I think the hotel needs to work a lot better to provide consistent information regarding their shuttle service. A flier or card for guests who will need a return shuttle (with times/phone numbers/etc)would have been helpful and perhaps better training of staff to give accurate and consistent information when questions are asked.    I parked in the timed limited spots near the front door on arrival as it was not clear where long term parking would be. I was told when checking in to park in the lot and bring my ticket back for validation and that I would be good to go when I returned 5 days later. When I returned 10 minutes later the next clerk said I would need to stop at the front desk to have my ticket validated when I got back on the return shuttle. When I checked out, the next morning, I asked again and was told I needed to stop back at the front desk. (I was a little worried line could be long on the way back).    The shuttle to the airport was great. I was dropped off at my terminal 5 and asked the driver what to do for the return shuttle. I asked if it was at the Bus/Shuttle entrance, but he said, no since you're in Terminal 5 call when you get back and they would make a T5 stop to pick me up when that shuttle came through.    Upon arriving back, I called the hotel and a shuttle was just about the leave and would coming through T5 shortly. The clerk who answered did not seem confident about the exact location or even the color of the shuttle which was a little worrisome. She said if I missed it to just wait 45 minutes for the next one. The waiting area in T5 is on a narrow curb between lanes of moving traffic and it was only 50 degrees outside. It is also difficult to talk to someone when calling the number. You have to listen to a long list of options, then stay on hold and hope someone actually answers the line.    The shuttle did come along but there was a massive line of people to get on this shuttle. It was very unclear whether there would be enough room for everyone and the shuttle driver did not sort that out up front but was saying he wasn't sure if all the luggage was going to fit and some of might need to wait for the next shuttle (45 minutes later!). I wish he could have just done a quick head count and let us know but he spent 20 minutes loading luggage into the back when it was unclear if everyone would even have a seat. My luggage was large and I didn't want him to have to unload everyone else's to get mine out if there wasn't going to be a seat. After waiting 5 minutes with no answer, I decided to take a cab back. However, none off the cabs from T5 would take me such a short distance (I don't think that's actually legal to refuse fares, but they did!).    I took the tram to terminal 3 and got in a monitored taxi line and put my luggage in the trunk myself. The taxi driver was furious when I gave the destination. He slammed his hands on the wheel and took off saying he'd waited 5 hours for a fare. I had planned on tipping generously, but the ride was uncomfortable with him complaining the whole way. We ended up passing the hotel shuttle on the way and he was pointing telling me I should have taken that.    Upon arrival back at the hotel, there was a gigantic line of flight attendants and pilots checking out at the front desk. I got in line and waited because I was told I had to get my ticket re-validated at the front desk. When I got to the front of the line, I was told I didn't need to stop there and to just press the intercom button on my way out. I did mention that I would have been nice to know that before I waited a long time in the line and that I was told I need to wait when I checked in.    There were some shuttle passengers in line behind me at the front desk, they mentioned there actually was one free seat; however, there would not have been room for my large bag.    In the end, I just wanted to get home after a long trip but the return shuttle service was horrible. I will pick another hotel with more frequent shuttle service next time I do a park, stay, fly package. Waiting for the next shuttle isn't a big deal if they come frequently, but waiting another 45 minutes would have been unbearable given the long drive I had ahead.    I consider this horrific customer service failure.",-0.9747,1,2

First they said there was too much traffic (there was not), then they kept saying the driver should be there soon. After increasing the frequency of calls, they finally called the driver and told us he just passed by 2 min ago, which was not true because we had been waiting on the streets for the past half hour. In all these phone calls we had told them at least twice that we were waiting at the upper level. After an hour of waiting in the cold, we were told to go to the lower level. If the staff had paid attention, we needn't have waited so long, because right at the first call they could have asked us to go to the lower level, when we told them we were at the upper level.

However, so are a dozen of other hotels in a mile radius without being on this city block right across from a fire station. The noise of the emergency vehicles is just too much. Why staying at a place right on that block? In our case is simple, we did not do our research and realized that before booking.  The other big disappointment of the place is that we booked thinking we were getting ""breakfast"" included in the price. Let me describe what it is called breakfast here, 1) Medium roast watery coffee and hot water for on type of black tea, oranges (only fruit provided), cereal, two flavors of yogurt, and some industrial-grade pre-packed muffins. not other pastry items, no bread at all, no butter, no jelly, no cream cheese, nothing else. There are two hot items though: scrambled eggs and turkey sausage patties. These items were all the same for five straights mornings that we spent at this hotel.  In conclusion, we ended up going to WholeFoods (0.5 mile from the hotel) bought some items like bread, bananas, and cream cheese, and every morning we will get some decent coffee from a local place and cater our own simple breakfast in the room.    The only reason I gave the hotel three stars is because the room is cleaned, and the front desk person is very attentive.    We will be back to Chicago in October, not to this hotel.",-0.9201,1,2

It was raining lightly, dark and we got a little lost trying to find the hotel. Mostly we were just tired. The front desk person ushered us quickly into the hotel lobby's bathroom per our request. Prior to arrival, we had asked for a quiet room, and got a quiet room. (The most important aspect of a stay in a hotel for us.) Some reviewers talk about a ""brick wall"" and I'm confused by this description. Out our window, there was a street, and then a building across the street that had brick, but it wasn't as if we were staring at brick a foot away from the window or anything?!? (I've stayed in hotels in India, for example, where that was the case.) The room's temperature was difficult to regulate for us, and we slept poorly because of it. We went to breakfast early (as signs in the elevator recommended). We had plenty of room/space to ourselves. There was a lot of variety at breakfast, and my favorite was the berry compote, which wasn't something I would get at another hotel. Quite tasty. We checked out at around noon, nervously trying to figure out how we were going to get to the airport. Before our trip started, I had written to the hotel about the whole question, and the General Manager had written back a couple helpful suggestions on the different options we had. On the day of departure, though, we still were undecided, and took the ""L"" straight to the airport. Maneuvering the metro's entrance, the ticket machines, the stairs ... I would not do again with a bunch of luggage. It was stressful. I used the hotel's business center the morning before our departure, and was able to make the call I needed to -- in spite of the fact, like at many Hyatt Place's the business center is really just part of the lobby. It worked in a pinch, though. Because of our trouble getting to the airport (my partner is disabled), I tried to cancel a future reservation and stay out near Ohare at a Hyatt, and it was a hassle to cancel our existing reservation, partly because I had booked through a third party, but in the end, the General Manager made the situation right. We've traveled a lot in the world, and are picky travelers, especially about our hotels, so I'm assuming most travelers will stay and have a pleasant visit.",-0.7058,1,0

I’m not sure if it was just our 1 bedroom suite, but this one had a small desk and couch (in terrible disrepair) and sitting chair. Normally there is a small table in the kitchen, but this suite didn’t.    This isn’t your “normal” Residence Inn, it’s a repurposed building so the classic 1 bedrooms are long and narrow - but if you have a family you’ll enjoy a little space.    There’s a full sized fridge and hot plate and microwave, but I wouldn’t waste time cooking a meal in downtown Chicago - there are too many great restaurants in the area.    The breakfast was shockingly fair - ample basic hot selections.    The biggest negative was how dirty the room was: I stabbed my foot on an earring left from the previous guests.

The QR code in the room for menu options led us to a dead end of “take out only” and limiting the restaurant hours to closing at 2pm. One would assume this to be correct? I called the front desk twice for opening/closing times and both times received conflicting info on hours, even conflicting what front desk would tell us in person 30 minutes later.

It is located on the southern edge of the campus. It’s comparable to a business hotel (such as Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt), but the “business” of the University of Chicago involves “study.” Hence, it is aptly named.    A nearby parking deck is still under construction. As a result, I worried about parking. However, unmetered parking is available on the Midway Plaisance in front of the hotel. Arriving about 6 pm on a Friday and departing about noon on a Sunday, I had no trouble whatsoever finding a place to park there. When I made my reservation, they told me that they had placards for parking in the Law School lot if no spaces were available on the Midway.    Food is available in the hotel in the bar (called “Truth be Told”) so the menu is limited. Because it was not open for breakfast, a limited (but free) continental breakfast was available in the lobby. It included yogurt, fruit, pastries, and coffee.    I was there for a college reunion. For many people, I suspect, the hotel’s appeal is the UChicago location. Keep in mind, though, that some of the university hospitals are a half-mile away as are some of the athletic facilities and dorms. The hotel is adjacent to the new conference center (David Rubenstein Forum). It is also close to the Law School, the dorms south of 60th Street, and the Crown School (formerly Social Service Administration). It’s just across the Midway from Rockefeller Chapel and Ida Noyes Hall.    Because it is in the midst of the university, you won’t find a convenience store, a drugstore, or restaurants nearby. Some limited eating facilities are found around the campus. It’s a few blocks from a Metra Electric commuter rail station, and CTA buses run in the vicinity. When I was an undergraduate at the university, there was concern about assaults and robberies in the neighborhood, a concern that was echoed by some current undergraduates with whom I talked. The University of Chicago has its own police force, and I often saw their patrol cars. The worst I experienced as a student was the theft of an electric horn from my bicycle, but I’d remind you that Chicago is a big city with some big city problems. So be alert.    One thing that has changed since my undergraduate days is the extent of landscaping on the Midway. When it’s spring and the leaves are green, the hotel’s surroundings are beautiful. Across the Midway is some of the university’s gothic architecture that, according to some, constitutes the campus most closely resembling Hogwarts. A window overlooking 60th Street could provide an ideal view. Although railroad tracks are not far way, I was not disturbed by the noise of passing trains.    The décor was modern and restrained. My room was spacious with a sense of warmth from the wooden furniture. There was no microwave or refrigerator. The closet was small, but there was an ironing board and iron. Staff were uniformly friendly and welcoming.",-0.8643,1,2

The suite consisted of two room of which I used one of them.    Pros    Location: easy access to public transportation. The Orange line train to/from Midway and Blue line train to Ohare are a block away. The lakefront is also just a couple of blocks away.    Price: While certainly not cheap, three nights in a private room for under $500, given the location, is very reasonable.    Con    Check in is at 4pm. While that policy is clear and not an issue, what ends up happening at 4 is everyone who has been waiting to check in swarms the front desk. The check in process tends to be slow which might be related to the varying languages of the guests since there are many visitors from outside the US. A suggestion to the staff is let guests check-in whenever they arrive and then give them their room cards at 4pm. It would really speed up the process.    You need to scan your card to open doors to the elevator, access your floor once on the elevator, then your suite door and finally your room. The security is good, but the card readers do not work well. It is especially a problem on the elevators which take multiple swipes. Another odd and potentially dangerous thing is that my room card opened not only my room, but the other one in the suite. I only found this out when I got to my suite and did no know which of the two rooms was mine. I tried the first one and it let me. I found it was empty, but the suitcases of the guests in that room were present so I knew it wasn't my room. Not sure if this was an error in the card setup or a flaw in the system.    Sound travels. The party in the room next to me were having a loud party that went well into the early morning hours. You could hear every word being spoken.    Breakfast.
